### ART-1 — Article Publish Server Error + TipTap Duplicate Extension Fix

**Goal:** Fix "Server Error" on article publish, silence TipTap duplicate-extension warnings, improve error display, and suppress noisy 401s on admin pages.

**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### Root Causes

| # | Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `[tiptap warn]: Duplicate extension names found: ['link', 'underline']` | `@tiptap/starter-kit@3.23.5` bundles `extension-link` and `extension-underline` internally — adding them again as standalone caused duplicates |
| 2 | "Server Error" shown for all backend failures | `actions.ts` only read `json.message`, missing Laravel's `json.errors` validation detail |
| 3 | `/api/auth/customer/me` 401 on every admin page | `CustomerAuthProvider` in `app/layout.tsx` wraps all routes including `/admin/**` and calls `/me` unconditionally on mount |
| 4 | Locale tab content not syncing | `prevValueRef = { current: value }` was a plain object recreated each render — `setContent` never ran when switching EN → DE |
| 5 | `API_URL` missing private env var fallback | Server action used `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` only |
| 6 | `es` locale missing from `ArticleInput` type | Type only had `en/de/fr` |

#### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `components/admin/article-rich-editor.tsx` | `StarterKit.configure({ link: false, underline: false })` — disables bundled link/underline so our standalone configured versions win; fixed locale sync by removing broken `prevValueRef` pattern |
| `app/admin/articles/actions.ts` | Added `extractError()` helper — parses `json.errors` field map and formats as readable lines; applied to `createArticle` + `updateArticle`; `API_URL` private fallback; added `es` to translations type |
| `components/admin/article-form.tsx` | Error banner uses `<pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-sans">` so multi-line validation errors render correctly |
| `context/CustomerAuthContext.tsx` | `refreshCustomer` bails out early on `/admin/**` paths — no more 401 noise in admin network tab |

#### Backend Notes (for backend team)
- Ensure `PUT /admin/articles/{id}` and `POST /admin/articles` accept `body` as an HTML string (not `string[]`)
- Return 422 with `errors` object on validation failure, not 500
- HTML sanitizer should strip unknown tags silently, not throw — TipTap outputs `<p>`, `<h1>`–`<h3>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, `<s>`, `<code>`, `<pre>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<blockquote>`, `<hr>`, `<a href target rel>`, `<img src alt>`, `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`, `style` on block elements (text-align), `class` on `<pre>`

## Completed in Latest Session — LOG-2: Logistics Dashboard v2 (2026-05-21)

---

### LOG-2 — Logistics Dashboard v2 / Unified Operations View (Frontend)

**Goal:** Upgrade the Logistics Dashboard to reflect the full order workflow and include both website and eBay orders. The old dashboard showed no useful data because it predated payment milestones, customer acceptance, financial locks, eBay imports, and shipment release.

**Commits:** `af5038c`
**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### Root Cause of Empty Dashboard
The old `LogisticsOrder` type had no `payment_stage`, `source`, `customer_acceptance_status`, or eBay fields. Only 4 summary cards existed. The status filter didn't include `awaiting_proforma` / `awaiting_confirmation` / `awaiting_acceptance`. Empty state said "There are no active shipments to review."

#### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `components/admin/logistics-dashboard.tsx` | Full upgrade — expanded types, 9-card summary, new filters, new table columns, eBay source badge, payment-gate on GenBtn, updated empty state |
| `app/admin/logistics/page.tsx` | Updated subtitle to "Unified operations view — website and eBay orders requiring logistics action" |

#### Type Changes
- `LogisticsOrder` — added `payment_stage`, `customer_acceptance_status`, `financials_locked`, `financials_revision_required`, `source`, `ebay_order_id`, `ebay_payment_status`, `ebay_fulfillment_status`
- `LogisticsSummary` — expanded from 4 fields to 9 new fields with legacy fallback compat

#### 9-Card Summary Grid
| Card | Field |
|---|---|
| Ready for Logistics | `ready_for_logistics` (falls back to `ready_for_shipment`) |
| Awaiting Acceptance | `awaiting_acceptance` |
| Awaiting Deposit | `awaiting_deposit` |
| Deposit Paid / Docs Needed | `deposit_paid_docs_needed` |
| Balance Due | `balance_due` |
| Ready for Shipment Release | `ready_for_shipment_release` |
| eBay Needing Fulfilment | `ebay_needing_fulfillment` |
| Missing Documents | `missing_documents` |
| EU Compliance Pending | `eu_compliance_pending` |

#### New Filters (sent as query params to backend)
- `source` → `all / website / ebay`
- `payment_stage` → full enum
- `acceptance_status` → `pending / accepted / rejected`
- `ebay_fulfillment_status` → `not_started / in_progress / fulfilled / cancelled`
- Status filter updated: added `awaiting_proforma`, `awaiting_confirmation`, `awaiting_acceptance`
- Existing: `status`, `missing_document`, `risk_level`, `reverse_charge_only`, `page`

#### New Table Columns
- **Pay. Stage** — `PAYMENT_STAGE_COLORS` + `PAYMENT_STAGE_LABEL` maps
- **Acceptance** — `ACCEPTANCE_COLORS` map
- **Order cell** — green eBay badge (`ShoppingBag` icon) shown below ref when `source === "ebay"`
- **Payment cell** — eBay orders show `ebay_payment_status` + `ebay_fulfillment_status` stacked; website orders show standard `payment_status`
- **Status cell** — financials locked icon (`Lock`) shown inline when `financials_locked === true`

#### Generate Button Gating
`isDocGated(docKey, order)` checks `payment_stage`:
- CI / PL → gated until `deposit_paid` or later stage
- DN → gated until `shipment_released` or `status === "delivered"`
- `payment_stage = null` (legacy orders) → no gate applied
- Gated buttons render as a locked grey pill with tooltip; actual enforcement is backend-side

#### Empty State
Changed from "There are no active shipments to review." → "No logistics actions are currently pending."

## Completed in Latest Session — EB-5: eBay Order Sync + Blog Rich Text Editor (2026-05-21)

---

### EB-5 — eBay Order Status Sync (Frontend)

**Goal:** Sync eBay seller orders into Okelcor admin — new "eBay Orders" tab on `/admin/ebay`, source badge in orders table, eBay info panel in order detail, 3 proxy routes.

**Commits:** `d516c68`
**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### Files Changed / Added

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `lib/admin-api.ts` | Added `source?: string \| null` to `AdminOrder`; added `EbayOrder`, `EbaySyncResult` types; added eBay fields to `AdminOrderFull` (`ebay_order_id`, `ebay_order_status`, `ebay_payment_status`, `ebay_fulfillment_status`, `ebay_buyer_username`, `ebay_last_synced_at`) |
| `app/api/admin/ebay/orders/route.ts` | **New** — GET proxy → `GET /admin/ebay/orders` with filters (`payment_status`, `fulfillment_status`, `page`) |
| `app/api/admin/ebay/orders/sync/route.ts` | **New** — POST proxy → `POST /admin/ebay/orders/sync` |
| `app/api/admin/ebay/orders/[ebayOrderId]/sync/route.ts` | **New** — POST proxy → `POST /admin/ebay/orders/{ebayOrderId}/sync` |
| `components/admin/orders-table.tsx` | Added `SourceBadge` (green ShoppingBag when `source === "ebay"`) rendered below order ref |
| `components/admin/order-detail.tsx` | Added eBay source info panel in overview tab when `order.source === "ebay"` (order ID, buyer, payment/fulfillment status badges, last synced) |
| `app/admin/ebay/page.tsx` | Added `EbayOrdersPanel` component + `pageTab` state to switch between "Product Listings" and "eBay Orders" tabs; panel has filters, bulk sync, per-row sync, pagination |

#### Backend Endpoints Required
```
GET  /api/v1/admin/ebay/orders?payment_status=&fulfillment_status=&page=
POST /api/v1/admin/ebay/orders/sync
POST /api/v1/admin/ebay/orders/{ebayOrderId}/sync
```

### Blog/News Rich Text Editor Upgrade (Frontend)

**Goal:** Replace the simple ParagraphBuilder in the article CMS with a full TipTap v3 rich text editor. Backward compatible with legacy `string[]` article bodies.

**Commits:** `077680b`
**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### Files Changed / Added

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `components/admin/article-rich-editor.tsx` | **New** — TipTap v3 editor with Write/Preview/HTML tabs, full toolbar (H1–H3, bold/italic/underline/strike/code, bullet/ordered lists, blockquote, code block, HR, align left/center/right, link, image, table), DOMPurify preview sanitization |
| `components/admin/article-form.tsx` | Replaced `ParagraphBuilder` with `ArticleRichEditor`; `body` field changed from `string[]` to `string`; `bodyToHtml()` migrates legacy arrays on load |
| `lib/admin-api.ts` | `ArticleTranslation.body` changed from `string[]` to `string \| string[]` |
| `lib/api.ts` | `ApiArticle.body` changed from `string[] \| null` to `string \| string[] \| null` |
| `components/news/data.ts` | `ArticleContent.body` changed from `string[]` to `string \| string[]` |
| `app/admin/articles/actions.ts` | `ArticleLocale.body` changed from `string[]` to `string` |
| `components/news/article-ui.tsx` | Added `renderBody()` — detects HTML string vs legacy `string[]`; HTML body rendered via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with full prose styles |
| `app/news/[slug]/page.tsx` | `toArticle()` body mapping updated for `string \| string[]` |

#### Packages Installed
```
@tiptap/react@3.23.5  @tiptap/pm  @tiptap/starter-kit@3.23.5
@tiptap/extension-underline  @tiptap/extension-link  @tiptap/extension-image
@tiptap/extension-table  @tiptap/extension-placeholder  @tiptap/extension-text-align
dompurify@3.4.5  @types/dompurify
```

#### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy articles with `body: string[]` are converted to HTML by `bodyToHtml()` on editor load — no data migration needed
- Public article rendering detects HTML strings (starts with `<`) vs legacy arrays and renders accordingly

## Completed in Latest Session — DOC-7/8/9: Payment Milestones, Email Notifications & Workflow Command Center (2026-05-21)

---

### DOC-7 — Payment Milestone Workflow (Frontend)

**Goal:** Full deposit/balance payment milestone tracking visible to both admin and customer, with payment-stage-gating on trade document generation.

**Commits:** `a1ef863`
**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### Files Changed / Added

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `lib/admin-api.ts` | Added `payment_stage`, `deposit_percent`, `deposit_amount`, `deposit_paid_at`, `balance_amount`, `balance_paid_at`, `shipment_released_at`, `shipment_release_note` to `AdminOrderFull` |
| `lib/admin-permissions.ts` | Added `"payments.release_shipment"` permission for `super_admin`, `admin`, `order_manager` |
| `components/admin/payment-milestones-card.tsx` | **New** — 5-step milestone progress card for admin order detail; Mark Deposit Paid / Mark Balance Paid / Release Shipment action buttons with role permission gating |
| `components/admin/trade-documents-card.tsx` | Added `paymentStage` + `orderStatus` props; Commercial Invoice and Packing List gated until `deposit_paid`; Delivery Note gated until `shipment_released` or `delivered`; graceful degradation when `paymentStage` is null (old orders unaffected) |
| `components/admin/order-detail.tsx` | Wired `PaymentMilestonesCard` into Payments tab; passes all milestone fields as props |
| `components/account/payment-milestone-progress.tsx` | **New** — customer-facing read-only 5-step timeline (deposit_requested → shipment_released) with dates and amounts |
| `components/account/order-payment-card.tsx` | Added `paymentStage`, `depositAmount`, `balanceAmount` props; bank transfer section shows staged amount highlight box when deposit/balance stage active |
| `app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx` | Renders `PaymentMilestoneProgress` after `OrderPaymentCard` when stage is past `pending_proforma`; passes payment stage props |
| `app/account/orders/page.tsx` | Added `payment_stage`, `deposit_amount`, `balance_amount`, `deposit_paid_at`, `balance_paid_at` to `Order` type |

#### Payment Stage Enum
```
pending_proforma → deposit_requested → deposit_paid → balance_due → balance_paid → shipment_released
```

#### Trade Document Gating Logic
- `commercialGated = !!paymentStage && !DEPOSIT_PAID_STAGES.has(paymentStage)` — blocks until `deposit_paid`
- `packingGated` — same rule as commercial
- `deliveryGated = !!paymentStage && !SHIPMENT_RELEASED_STAGES.has(paymentStage) && !isDelivered`
- Null `paymentStage` (legacy orders) → no gates applied

#### Backend Endpoints Required
```
POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/payments/mark-deposit-paid
POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/payments/mark-balance-paid
POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/payments/release-shipment
  ← All return updated order fields (payment_stage, *_paid_at, etc.)
```

---

### DOC-8 — Payment Milestone Email Notifications (Frontend)

**Goal:** Show per-milestone email status in admin panel (Sent/Not Sent with timestamp), Resend button per sent milestone, toast after milestone actions indicating whether customer was notified.

**Commits:** `8c8acd4`
**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### Files Changed / Added

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `lib/admin-api.ts` | Added email tracking fields to `AdminOrderFull`: `deposit_requested_email_sent_at`, `deposit_paid_email_sent_at`, `balance_due_email_sent_at`, `balance_paid_email_sent_at`, `shipment_released_email_sent_at` (null = not sent, ISO string = sent at date) |
| `components/admin/payment-milestones-card.tsx` | Full rewrite — added `MailCheck`/`MailX`/`RotateCcw` icons; `emailSent` state per stage; `resendLoading` state; toast system (emerald success / amber warning); `callAction` returns `{ok, emailSent}` and updates email state from backend echo; `handleResendEmail(stage)` POSTs to resend endpoint; per-step email status row shows icon + date or "Email not sent" + Resend button |
| `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/payments/resend-milestone-email/route.ts` | **New** — thin proxy `POST /admin/orders/{id}/payments/resend-milestone-email` with Bearer auth |

#### Email Status Display Logic
- Each reached milestone shows: `MailCheck` green + "Email sent [date]" OR `MailX` gray + "Email not sent" + Resend button
- Action buttons (Mark Paid / Release): after success, show toast "Customer notified by email" (emerald) or "Action saved — email notification failed" (amber) based on backend echo
- Resend: success → updates email timestamp in state; error → amber toast with message

#### Backend Endpoints Required
```
POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/payments/resend-milestone-email
  body: { stage: "deposit_requested" | "deposit_paid" | "balance_due" | "balance_paid" | "shipment_released" }
  ← Returns updated order fields including email_sent_at timestamps
```
Mark-paid / release-shipment endpoints should echo back `*_email_sent_at` fields in their response so the frontend can update email status without a refetch.

---

### DOC-9 — Admin Order Workflow Command Center (Frontend)

**Goal:** Add a persistent Workflow Command Center panel to admin order detail showing current state, color-coded next action, and reorganize all content into six tabs with attention badges.

**Commits:** `89f4cb5`
**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `components/admin/order-detail.tsx` | Full structural rewrite — added Command Center panel, 6-tab navigation, `getNextAction()` function, tab badge logic; all existing state/handlers/modals preserved |

#### Command Center Panel
- Always visible at top of order detail
- Header: order ref pill + status badge + payment status badge + (if set) payment stage badge + acceptance badge + financial lock badge + declaration badge
- Next Action block: color-coded left border (red/amber/blue/green), priority icon, label, sublabel, "Go to [tab] →" shortcut button (hidden when already on target tab)

#### `getNextAction()` — 12-Rule Priority Chain
| Priority | Rule |
|---|---|
| 🔴 Red | Cancelled, customer rejected, financial revision pending |
| 🟡 Amber | Acceptance pending, deposit awaited, balance awaited, bank transfer awaited, order needs confirming, EU declaration pending |
| 🔵 Blue | Generate commercial invoice (post deposit), release shipment (post balance paid), upload shipment docs (post release) |
| 🟢 Green | All clear — order fully complete |

#### Six-Tab Navigation
| Tab | Content |
|---|---|
| Overview | Status editor, customer/order info grid, order items table, order actions |
| Payments | Financial lock banner, revision card, acceptance card, PaymentMilestonesCard, mark-paid shortcut |
| Documents | TradeDocumentsCard |
| Logistics | ShipmentEventManager |
| Compliance | EU entry certificate panel (empty state when `declaration_required === null`) |
| Activity | ActivityLog |

#### Tab Badges (amber dot)
- **Payments**: financial lock active, revision required, acceptance pending, or pending payment stage
- **Documents**: any non-superseded/non-void trade doc in draft/issued status
- **Logistics**: no shipment events yet and order is confirmed/shipped
- **Compliance**: declaration required but not acknowledged

## Completed in Latest Session — DOC-1: Order Confirmation Stage (2026-05-19)

---

### DOC-1 — Order Confirmation (AB) Between Proposal and Proforma Invoice

**Goal:** Insert an Order Confirmation (AB-YYYY-XXXX) stage between proposal acceptance and Proforma Invoice generation. Proforma remains a manual admin action.

**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### Flow Change

```
BEFORE:  Proposal (AN) → Order → auto-generate Proforma Invoice (PI)
AFTER:   Proposal (AN) → Order (status: awaiting_proforma)
                       → Generate Order Confirmation (AB)   ← NEW manual step
                       → Generate Proforma Invoice (PI)     ← still manual, unchanged
```

#### Files Changed / Added

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `lib/admin-api.ts` | `TradeDocument.type` union extended with `"order_confirmation"`; `AdminOrder.status` union extended with `"awaiting_proforma"` |
| `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/trade-documents/order-confirmation/route.ts` | **New** — POST proxy → `POST /admin/orders/{id}/trade-documents/order-confirmation` with Bearer token |
| `components/admin/trade-documents-card.tsx` | Added `order_confirmation` to `TYPE_LABEL`, `TYPE_DESCRIPTION`, `INLINE_GENERATED`; added `orderConf` generate state + `hasOrderConf` derived; added indigo "Generate Order Confirmation" button (appears first, before Proforma); added `orderConf.error` display |
| `components/account/trade-documents-card.tsx` | Added `order_confirmation` to `TYPE_LABEL`, `TYPE_DESCRIPTION`, `INLINE_GENERATED` — customers can view/download the Order Confirmation PDF inline |
| `components/admin/order-detail.tsx` | Added `"awaiting_proforma"` to `ORDER_STATUSES`; added `awaiting_proforma: "bg-indigo-100 text-indigo-700"` to `STATUS_STYLES`; added `STATUS_LABEL` map (fixes snake_case badge rendering); updated dropdown options to use `STATUS_LABEL` |
| `components/admin/orders-table.tsx` | Added `"awaiting_proforma"` to `STATUS_OPTIONS`; added `STATUS_LABEL` map; updated `StatusBadge` and filter dropdown to use label map; added `awaiting_proforma: "bg-indigo-100 text-indigo-700"` to `STATUS_STYLES` |
| `app/admin/orders/actions.ts` | Added `"awaiting_proforma"` to `OrderStatus` type so `updateOrderStatus` server action accepts the new status |

#### Backend Endpoints Required (frontend is ready)

```
POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/trade-documents/order-confirmation
  ← { data: TradeDocument }   (same contract as /proforma, /commercial-invoice etc.)
  Document type must be: "order_confirmation"
  Number format:         AB-YYYY-XXXX
```

#### Safety Constraints Met
- No changes to proforma route or generation logic — existing PI documents unaffected
- Customer filter (`status !== "superseded" && status !== "void"`) unchanged — order_confirmation visible, superseded order_confirmations hidden
- Historical orders with no order_confirmation simply show no button (hasOrderConf guard)
- `awaiting_proforma` falls through to `bg-gray-100 text-gray-500` in any component that hasn't been updated (graceful fallback via `?? "bg-gray-100 text-gray-500"`)

### Admin → System Health Page (NEW)

**Feature:** `/admin/system-health` — real-time infrastructure and endpoint monitor visible to `super_admin` and `admin` roles.

**Commits:** `8ae5911`
**TypeScript: 0 errors**

#### Files Added / Changed

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `app/api/admin/system/health/route.ts` | Proxy `GET /api/v1/admin/system/health` with Bearer token |
| `app/api/admin/system/errors/route.ts` | Proxy `GET /api/v1/admin/system/errors?limit=N` with Bearer token |
| `app/admin/system-health/page.tsx` | Full client-side health dashboard (~500 lines) |
| `lib/admin-permissions.ts` | Added `system_health` section (super_admin + admin); path mapping; `system.manage` permission |
| `components/admin/admin-shell.tsx` | "System Health" nav entry with `Activity` icon |

#### Dashboard Sections

- **Overall status banner** — green/amber/red ring: "All Systems Healthy / Issues Detected / Critical Problems"
- **6 summary cards** — Overall, Critical count, Warnings, Failed Jobs, Last Backup, Recent Error count
- **Health group cards** — 2-column grid; groups: Application, Database, Queue/Backups, Mail, Security, API Endpoints, Integrations; each check shows status icon, message, fix hint on fail/warning
- **Issues requiring attention** — flattened, severity-sorted list of all non-passing checks
- **Recent errors table** — time, METHOD/route, level badge, message, IP — no secrets or stack traces exposed
- **Run Health Check** button with spinner + auto-fetch on mount
- Graceful fallback: shows "Backend integration pending" if endpoint returns 404

#### Backend Routes Required

```
GET /api/v1/admin/system/health
GET /api/v1/admin/system/errors?limit=N
```

Expected health response shape:
```json
{
  "overall": "pass | warning | fail",
  "generated_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "last_backup": "ISO timestamp | null",
  "failed_jobs": 0,
  "summary": { "total": 0, "pass": 0, "warning": 0, "fail": 0, "critical": 0 },
  "groups": [
    {
      "group": "application",
      "label": "Application",
      "checks": [
        {
          "key": "app_env",
          "label": "App Environment",
          "status": "pass | warning | fail",
          "severity": "low | medium | high | critical",
          "message": "...",
          "fix_hint": "... | null"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Mandatory Admin 2FA Setup — Token Auth Bug Fix (2026-05-18)

**Problem:** QR code showed "unavailable" and backend returned "Unauthenticated." — setup token was being sent the wrong way.

**Commits:** `474f4e8`

#### Root Causes (4 bugs fixed)

| # | File | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `app/admin/actions.ts` | `json.data?.temp_token` — but backend puts `temp_token` at top level | `json.temp_token ?? json.data?.temp_token` |
| 2 | `app/api/admin/2fa/enable/route.ts` | Used `admin_setup_token` as Bearer on normal `/admin/2fa/enable` endpoint | When only setup token: `POST /admin/2fa/setup/enable` with `{ temp_token }` in body — no Bearer |
| 3 | `app/api/admin/2fa/setup/confirm/route.ts` | Sent `admin_setup_token` as `Authorization: Bearer` | Send `{ temp_token, code }` in body; handle response with or without `data` wrapper |
| 4 | `app/admin/login/page.tsx` | `useState(() => fetchQr())` — wrong hook, is a no-op side effect | `useEffect(() => fetchQr(), [])` + added `useEffect` import |

#### Correct Backend Endpoints for Mandatory Setup Flow

```
POST /api/v1/admin/2fa/setup/enable    body: { temp_token }              # get QR/secret
POST /api/v1/admin/2fa/setup/confirm   body: { temp_token, code }        # confirm TOTP + get full session
```

The temp token goes in the **request body**, not as a Bearer header, for both setup endpoints.

### Mandatory Admin 2FA + 5-Hour Session (2026-05-18)

**Commits:** `4577470`

#### Part A — Mandatory 2FA Setup Flow

When the backend returns `{ requires_2fa_setup: true, temp_token: "..." }` on login:

1. `loginAdmin()` sets `admin_setup_token` cookie (httpOnly, 10-min TTL), returns `{ requires_2fa_setup: true }`
2. Login page transitions to `"2fa_setup"` view → `MandatoryTwoFactorSetupFlow` (non-skippable, no back button)
3. `useEffect` on mount → `POST /api/admin/2fa/enable` → proxy reads `admin_setup_token`, calls `POST /admin/2fa/setup/enable` with `{ temp_token }`
4. QR + manual key shown; admin scans and enters code
5. `POST /api/admin/2fa/setup/confirm` → proxy sends `{ temp_token, code }` → backend returns full token + recovery codes → full 5h session cookies set, `admin_setup_token` deleted
6. Recovery codes shown → "Continue to admin panel" → `window.location.replace("/admin")`

#### Part B — 5-Hour Session TTL

- `SESSION_MAX_AGE = 60 * 60 * 5` constant in `app/admin/actions.ts`
- All session cookies (`admin_token`, `admin_name`, `admin_display_name`, `admin_role`, `admin_role_label`, `admin_must_change`) use 5h `maxAge`
- `admin-shell.tsx`: `401` from `GET /api/admin/me` → `router.replace("/admin/login?expired=1")`
- Login page shows amber banner: *"Your admin session expired. Please sign in again."*
- `logoutAdmin()` also deletes `admin_setup_token` cookie

#### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `app/admin/actions.ts` | `SESSION_MAX_AGE = 60*60*5`; `requires_2fa_setup` handling; `logoutAdmin` clears `admin_setup_token` |
| `app/admin/login/page.tsx` | 3rd view state `"2fa_setup"` → `MandatoryTwoFactorSetupFlow`; `expired`/`setup_2fa` URL param banners in `Suspense` |
| `app/api/admin/2fa/enable/route.ts` | Split: `admin_token` → normal Bearer flow; `admin_setup_token` → `POST /admin/2fa/setup/enable` with body auth |
| `app/api/admin/2fa/setup/confirm/route.ts` | **New** — reads `admin_setup_token`, sends `{ temp_token, code }`, sets full 5h session cookies, returns recovery codes, deletes setup token |
| `components/admin/admin-shell.tsx` | `401` from `/api/admin/me` → redirect to `/admin/login?expired=1` |

#### Full Backend Contracts

```
POST /api/v1/admin/login
  ← { requires_2fa_setup: true, temp_token: "...", user: {...} }     # no 2FA configured yet
  ← { requires_2fa: true, data: { session_token: "..." } }           # existing 2FA users
  ← { data: { token: "...", user: {...} } }                           # direct login (no 2FA)

POST /api/v1/admin/2fa/setup/enable    body: { temp_token }
  ← { data: { otpauth_uri: "...", secret: "..." } }

POST /api/v1/admin/2fa/setup/confirm   body: { temp_token, code }
  ← { data: { token: "...", user: {...}, recovery_codes: ["...", ...] } }
```

### Trade Document Superseded Status (2026-05-18)

**Feature:** Admins see superseded/void trade documents with visual treatment. Customers never see them.

**Commits:** `56891e9`

#### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `lib/admin-api.ts` | `TradeDocument.status` union extended with `"superseded" \| "void"`; added `supersede_reason?: string \| null` |
| `components/admin/trade-documents-card.tsx` | Superseded docs: 60% opacity, strikethrough title, amber badge, reason shown, Send button hidden, Download remains enabled |
| `components/account/trade-documents-card.tsx` | Filter: `status !== "superseded" && status !== "void"` on both `tradeDocs` and `shipmentDocs` |

#### Behaviour

- **Admin view:** Superseded generated docs shown dimmed + strikethrough + reason text + "Superseded" badge. Send disabled, Download still works. Superseded shipment docs same treatment.
- **Customer view:** All `superseded` and `void` documents filtered out entirely — never rendered.

### eBay 502 Error — Surface Real Backend Errors (2026-05-18)

**Problem:** Next.js proxy catch blocks collapsed all eBay errors into the generic `"eBay action failed"` message. Backend reasons (e.g. misconfigured policies, missing fields) were never visible in the UI.

**Commits:** `a4cb50a`

#### Fix Pattern (applied to list + remove route handlers and server actions)

```typescript
// Read as text first to prevent silent JSON parse failure when hosting returns HTML
const text = await res.text();
let json: Record<string, unknown> = {};
try {
  json = JSON.parse(text);
} catch {
  console.error(`[handler] non-JSON response (HTTP ${res.status}):`, text.slice(0, 500));
  return { error: `eBay listing failed — backend returned HTTP ${res.status}. Check server logs.` };
}
if (!res.ok) {
  console.error(`[handler] backend error (HTTP ${res.status}):`, JSON.stringify(json));
}
// Chain: message → error → generic
return { error: json.message ?? json.error ?? `Failed (HTTP ${res.status}).` };
```

#### Files Changed

- `app/api/admin/products/[id]/ebay/list/route.ts` — text-first parse + error propagation
- `app/api/admin/products/[id]/ebay/remove/route.ts` — same pattern
- `app/admin/products/actions.ts` — `listOnEbay` + `removeFromEbay` same pattern

## Completed in Earlier Session — eBay Error 932: Trading API Quarantine (2026-05-18)

---

### Root Cause: Error 932 "Token irrevocably expired"

**Error 932** (`Das Authentifizierungs-Token ist unwiderruflich abgelaufen`) is a Trading API error. It comes from `lib/ebay.ts` using `EBAY_ACCESS_TOKEN` (a static env var) — not from the Laravel backend's DB-backed OAuth token.

**Three code paths were still calling `lib/ebay.ts` in production:**

| Admin action | Next.js entry point | Bad call chain |
|---|---|---|
| Products table eBay toggle | Server actions `listOnEbay` / `removeFromEbay` in `actions.ts` | → `listProductOnEbay()` / `removeProductFromEbay()` in `lib/ebay.ts` → Trading API (XML/SOAP) |
| eBay admin page toggle | `POST /api/admin/products/[id]/ebay/list` + `DELETE /remove` | → same `lib/ebay.ts` functions → Trading API |
| Sync from eBay button | `GET /api/admin/ebay/sync` | → `getActiveListings()` in `lib/ebay.ts` → Trading API |

**Clean paths (already correct, unaffected):** `/update` and `/refresh-status` route handlers were already pure Laravel proxies.

### Files Changed

#### `app/api/admin/products/[id]/ebay/list/route.ts` — full rewrite
Removed `listProductOnEbay` import from `lib/ebay.ts`. Now a pure proxy:
`POST ${API_URL}/admin/products/${id}/ebay/list` → Laravel backend (Sell API, DB token)

#### `app/api/admin/products/[id]/ebay/remove/route.ts` — full rewrite
Removed `removeProductFromEbay` import from `lib/ebay.ts`. Now a pure proxy:
`DELETE ${API_URL}/admin/products/${id}/ebay/remove` → Laravel backend

#### `app/api/admin/ebay/sync/route.ts` — full rewrite
Removed `getActiveListings` / `isEbayConfigured` imports from `lib/ebay.ts`. Now a pure proxy:
`GET ${API_URL}/admin/ebay/sync` → Laravel backend

#### `app/admin/products/actions.ts` — rewrite of `listOnEbay` + `removeFromEbay`
Removed `listProductOnEbay`, `removeProductFromEbay`, `EbayProduct` imports from `lib/ebay.ts`.
Both server actions now call the Laravel backend directly (same pattern as all other server actions):
- `listOnEbay(id)` → `POST ${API_URL}/admin/products/${id}/ebay/list`
- `removeFromEbay(id)` → `DELETE ${API_URL}/admin/products/${id}/ebay/remove`

#### `lib/ebay.ts` — quarantine notice added
Prominent block comment at top explains the file is quarantined. Lists exact backend routes to use instead. The file is kept for reference; its functions must never be re-imported into any listing flow.

### Final eBay Action Flow (All Seller Operations)

```
Admin UI (browser)
  → Next.js route handler or server action
    → Laravel backend EbaySellingService (DB-backed ebay_tokens OAuth)
      → eBay Sell API (REST)
```

`EBAY_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `EBAY_REFRESH_TOKEN` env vars are now irrelevant to any seller listing action.

### Verification
- `grep -r 'from.*lib/ebay' app/` → **no matches**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → **0 errors**

### Backend routes required (confirm Laravel has these)
- `POST   /api/v1/admin/products/{id}/ebay/list`
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/products/{id}/ebay/remove`
- `GET    /api/v1/admin/ebay/sync` → returns `{ activeCount, activeSKUs[], listings[], syncedAt }`

## Completed in Latest Session — eBay Business Policies: Expose in Readiness Panel (2026-05-14)

---

### eBay Business Policies — Fetch & Display Seller Business Policies

**Goal:** Surface the connected seller's eBay business policies (Payment, Fulfillment, Return) inside the Readiness Panel so admins can copy policy IDs into environment variables without leaving the admin.

**Commits:** pushed with EB-4 session
**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### New: `app/api/admin/ebay/policies/route.ts`
GET proxy → `GET /admin/ebay/policies`. Reads `admin_token` cookie, Bearer-authenticates to backend, returns raw policy payload. Gracefully returns `{}` on error.

#### New types in `app/admin/ebay/page.tsx`
```typescript
type EbayPolicy   = { id: string; name: string };
type EbayPolicies = { payment: EbayPolicy[]; fulfillment: EbayPolicy[]; return: EbayPolicy[] };
```

#### New helper: `normalizePolicies(raw)`
Handles all backend key-naming variants without requiring backend changes:
```typescript
payment:     pick("payment", "payment_policies", "paymentPolicies")
fulfillment: pick("fulfillment", "fulfillment_policies", "fulfillmentPolicies", "shipping", "shipping_policies", "shippingPolicies")
return:      pick("return", "return_policies", "returnPolicies")
```

#### Updated: `ReadinessPanel` sub-component (inside `app/admin/ebay/page.tsx`)
New state added to `ReadinessPanel`:
- `policies: EbayPolicies | null`
- `policiesLoading: boolean`
- `policiesError: string | null`
- `copiedId: string | null`

**"Fetch Business Policies" button:**
- Calls `GET /api/admin/ebay/policies`
- Normalizes response with `normalizePolicies()`
- Graceful: if backend returns error or empty, shows error message without breaking the panel

**Policies display (three groups):**
- Payment Policies
- Fulfillment Policies
- Return Policies

Per-policy row: policy name + policy ID (monospace) + "Copy ID" button. On click: copies ID to clipboard, button text changes to "Copied!" for 2 seconds, then resets.

**Help text:** References `EBAY_PAYMENT_POLICY_ID`, `EBAY_FULFILLMENT_POLICY_ID`, `EBAY_RETURN_POLICY_ID` env vars.

**Graceful degradation:** If backend policies endpoint not deployed, panel shows a dismissable error rather than blocking readiness checks.

---

**Backend endpoint required:**
- `GET /api/v1/admin/ebay/policies` → `{ payment: [{id, name}], fulfillment: [{id, name}], return: [{id, name}] }`
  - OR any of the key-name variants handled by `normalizePolicies()` (snake_case or camelCase)

---

## Completed in Latest Session — eBay Phase EB-1: OAuth Connection & Token Stability (2026-05-14)

---

### EB-1 — eBay OAuth Connection UI + Critical Bug Fixes

**Goal:** Make the eBay listing pipeline production-safe by adding an OAuth connection flow, connection status card, and fixing a critical broken action.

**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### New: `app/api/admin/ebay/status/route.ts`
GET proxy → `GET /admin/ebay/status`. Returns connection status object including `connected`, `marketplace_id`, `seller_username`, `last_refreshed_at`, `missing_config[]`. Graceful: non-2xx treated as unavailable (not a hard error).

#### New: `app/api/admin/ebay/auth-url/route.ts`
GET proxy → `GET /admin/ebay/auth-url`. Returns `{ data: { url, state } }`. Frontend redirects admin browser to the returned eBay OAuth URL.

#### New: `app/api/admin/ebay/disconnect/route.ts`
POST proxy → `POST /admin/ebay/disconnect`. Deactivates the active eBay token on the backend.

#### Fixed (critical): `app/admin/products/actions.ts`
**Root cause:** `listOnEbay()` and `removeFromEbay()` server actions were calling `${API_URL}/admin/products/{id}/ebay/list` — targeting the Laravel backend directly. This endpoint does not exist on Laravel. The listing logic lives in Next.js route handlers.

**Fix:** Both actions now import `listProductOnEbay()` and `removeProductFromEbay()` directly from `lib/ebay.ts` and call the Trading API themselves — identical logic to the route handlers but without the circular HTTP call. Also fixed `API_URL` to use `process.env.API_URL ?? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (private var first).

**Effect:** Products Table eBay toggle now works correctly.

#### Updated: `lib/admin-api.ts`
Added `ebay_item_id?: string | null` and `ebay_status?: string | null` to `AdminProduct` type. Previously only `ebay_listed?: boolean` existed.

#### Updated: `app/admin/ebay/page.tsx`
Full rewrite. New additions on top of existing listing manager:

**New `EbayConnectionStatus` type:**
```typescript
{
  connected: boolean;
  marketplace_id?: string;
  seller_username?: string | null;
  connected_at?: string | null;
  last_refreshed_at?: string | null;
  missing_config?: string[];
}
```

**`ConnectionCard` sub-component:**
- Connected state: green left-border card, shows marketplace/seller/last-refresh, "Disconnect" button
- Not connected state: amber left-border card, "Connect eBay Account" button, missing config list
- Loading state: animated skeleton placeholder
- Hidden entirely if status endpoint returns an error (graceful degradation — existing listing flow unaffected)

**OAuth flow:**
1. "Connect eBay Account" button → `GET /api/admin/ebay/auth-url` → `window.location.href = url`
2. eBay → backend callback → backend redirects to `/admin/ebay?connected=1` (or `?ebay_error=xxx`)
3. Frontend reads URL params on mount, shows 6-second auto-dismiss notification banner, cleans up URL with `router.replace("/admin/ebay")`

**Disconnect flow:**
- POST `/api/admin/ebay/disconnect` → optimistic state update → success notification

**Disabled states when not connected:**
- "Sync from eBay" button: `disabled` + tooltip "Connect eBay account first"
- Per-row "List on eBay" buttons: `disabled` + tooltip
- Bulk "List on eBay" bar: hidden
- Row checkboxes for unlisted products: hidden
- Amber warning banner shown above table: "Connect your eBay seller account above to enable listing and sync."
- `handleSync()`, `toggleEbay()`, `handleBulkList()` all guard with `if (!isConnected) return`

**Graceful degradation rule:** `isConnected = connStatus === null ? true : connStatus.connected`
If the status endpoint is not yet deployed or returns an error, `connStatus` stays `null` and `isConnected` defaults to `true` — all listing actions remain available.

---

**Backend endpoints required for EB-1 (not yet implemented):**
- `GET /api/v1/admin/ebay/auth-url` → `{ data: { url: string, state: string } }`
- `GET /api/v1/admin/ebay/status` → `{ data: { connected, marketplace_id, seller_username, connected_at, last_refreshed_at, missing_config[] } }`
- `POST /api/v1/admin/ebay/disconnect` → `{ message: "..." }`
- `GET /api/v1/admin/ebay/callback` → OAuth code exchange → redirect to `/admin/ebay?connected=1` or `?ebay_error=xxx`
- DB migration: `ebay_tokens` table (see backend spec)

---

## Completed in Latest Session — eBay Phase EB-4: Setup & Readiness Checklist (2026-05-14)

---

### EB-4 — Readiness Panel, Test Connection, Setup-Gated Actions

**Goal:** Before admins list products, show exactly what is configured, missing, or unsafe.

**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### New: `app/api/admin/ebay/readiness/route.ts`
GET proxy → `GET /admin/ebay/readiness`. Returns full readiness payload including checks array. Gracefully returns `null` on non-2xx so frontend doesn't block if endpoint isn't deployed.

#### New: `app/api/admin/ebay/test-connection/route.ts`
POST proxy → `POST /admin/ebay/test-connection`. Triggers token refresh + lightweight eBay API call on backend. Returns `{ message, success }`.

#### Updated: `app/admin/ebay/page.tsx`
Full rewrite for EB-4 on top of EB-3. Key additions:

**New types:** `ReadinessCheck`, `ReadinessData`, `TestResult`

**`fetchReadiness()` + useEffect:**
Calls `GET /api/admin/ebay/readiness` on mount. If endpoint returns non-2xx or throws, sets `readiness = null` — all actions remain available (graceful degradation). Populates `ReadinessData` with `checks[]`, `environment`, `marketplace_id`, `category_id`, `policies`, `seller_location`.

**`handleTestConnection()`:**
POST to `/api/admin/ebay/test-connection`, shows inline success/error message in the panel. Auto-clears after 8 seconds.

**`isReady` derived value:**
```typescript
const isReady = readiness === null ? true : !readiness.checks.some((c) => c.status === "fail");
```
Mirrors the `isConnected` graceful-degradation pattern from EB-1.

**`ReadinessPanel` sub-component:**
- Collapsible card (auto-expands when any check fails)
- Header: Settings gear icon (green/amber/red based on state) + pass/warning/fail counts
- Config tag strip: environment pill (green=production, amber=sandbox), marketplace_id, category_id, seller location
- Checklist grid (2-col on desktop): each check shows status icon (✓/⚠/✗) + label + optional message, colored background per status
- Help text: "Business policy IDs must come from the connected eBay seller account."
- "Test Connection" button (canManage only) + inline result message

**Setup-gated actions:**
All mutation actions now require both `isConnected && isReady`:
- Sync button: `disabled` with tooltip "Complete eBay setup before syncing"
- Bulk List toolbar: hidden when `!isReady`
- Bulk Update toolbar: hidden when `!isReady`
- Per-row List/Remove button: `disabled`
- Per-row Update button: `disabled`
- All function guards updated: `handleSync`, `toggleEbay`, `handleBulkList`, `handleBulkUpdate`, `updateListing`
- Header checkbox: `disabled` when `!isReady`

**Setup incomplete warning banner:**
Shown between "Not Connected" warning and the search bar when `readiness !== null && !isReady`:
> "Complete eBay setup before listing products. See the Setup & Readiness checklist above."

**Panel placement:** Connection Card → Readiness Panel → Stat Cards → Table

---

**Backend endpoints required for EB-4:**
- `GET /api/v1/admin/ebay/readiness` → full readiness payload with `checks[]` (key, label, status, message)
  - Required checks: client_id, client_secret, runame, connected, marketplace_id, category_id, payment_policy_id, fulfillment_policy_id, return_policy_id, seller_postal_code, environment, token_refresh
- `POST /api/v1/admin/ebay/test-connection` → refreshes token + calls eBay account endpoint → `{ success, message }`
- Do NOT expose secrets or tokens in the response

## Completed in Latest Session — eBay Phase EB-3: Price/Title Update Sync & Listing Validation (2026-05-14)

---

### EB-3 — Per-product Update Listing, Bulk Update, Stale Indicator, Confirmation Modals

**Goal:** Ensure eBay listings stay aligned with Okelcor product data after initial publish.

**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### New: `app/api/admin/products/[id]/ebay/update/route.ts`
PATCH proxy → `PATCH /admin/products/{id}/ebay/update`. Passes Bearer token. Returns updated eBay fields on success; surfaces backend validation errors (missing image, invalid price, etc.) directly to the frontend.

#### Updated: `lib/admin-api.ts`
Added `updated_at?: string | null` to `AdminProduct` type. Used by the "Needs update" stale indicator.

#### Updated: `app/admin/ebay/page.tsx`
Full rewrite for EB-3 on top of EB-2. Key additions:

**`isStale(product)` helper (module-level):**
Returns `true` when `product.updated_at > product.ebay_last_synced_at`. Safely returns `false` if either field is missing — indicator is entirely opt-in from the backend.

**Per-product "Update eBay Listing" action:**
- Visible for listed products when `canManage`
- Shows `Upload` icon button in the Action column (amber-tinted when stale, neutral otherwise)
- Clicking opens `ConfirmUpdateModal`: "Push latest price, title, description, and stock for [product] to eBay?"
- On confirm, calls `PATCH /api/admin/products/{id}/ebay/update`
- On success: optimistically updates `ebay_status → active`, `ebay_last_synced_at → now`, clears `ebay_sync_error`, shows success notification
- On failure: surfaces backend error message directly in action error banner (e.g. "Product needs at least one public image before listing on eBay.")
- Tracked by separate `updateLoading: Set<number>` state

**Bulk "Update Selected Listings" action:**
- Separate `selectedListed: Set<number>` state (distinct from `selected` for bulk listing)
- Listed product rows show blue checkboxes (vs orange for unlisted)
- Header checkbox context-aware: selects all listed on "eBay Live" tab, all unlisted otherwise
- Blue bulk update toolbar appears when `selectedListed.size > 0`
- Clicking "Update Selected Listings" → `ConfirmBulkUpdateModal` (shows count + disclaimer that individual failures don't abort the batch)
- Sequential PATCH calls with blue progress bar
- `bulkUpdateResult` banner on completion (blue for all-success, amber for partial failures)

**"Needs update" indicator:**
- Shown in eBay Status column as amber `Clock` badge: "Needs update"
- Conditionally rendered only when `isStale(product)` returns `true`
- Update button for that row is also amber-tinted as a visual cue
- Silently absent if backend does not return `updated_at`

**Action column for listed products now has three buttons:**
1. Remove (red, existing)
2. Update (blue/amber-on-stale, new EB-3) — opens confirmation modal
3. Refresh Status (sky, existing EB-2)

All three disabled (with `busy` flag) when any one operation is in flight for that product.

---

**Backend endpoints required for EB-3 (not yet implemented):**
- `PATCH /api/v1/admin/products/{id}/ebay/update` → calls Trading API `ReviseFixedPriceItem`; updates title, price, quantity; sets `ebay_last_synced_at`; clears `ebay_sync_error` on success; returns `{ ebay_status, ebay_last_synced_at, ebay_sync_error }`
- Validation before update: SKU present, title ≤ 80 chars, price > 0, stock > 0, at least one public https image, eBay account connected, business policies configured
- Safe error messages on each validation failure (surfaced directly to frontend)
- Sync-all endpoint should also call updateListing() per product, not fail whole batch on single error
- Products API should return `updated_at` to enable the stale indicator

---

## Completed in Latest Session — eBay Phase EB-2: Listing Status Tracking & Sync Logs (2026-05-14)

---

### EB-2 — eBay Status Visibility, RBAC Gates, Refresh Action, and Logs Panel

**Goal:** Make eBay operations visible and diagnosable before production testing.

**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean**

#### Updated: `lib/admin-api.ts`
Added three new fields to `AdminProduct` type:
```typescript
ebay_offer_id?: string | null;
ebay_last_synced_at?: string | null;
ebay_sync_error?: string | null;
```

#### Updated: `lib/admin-permissions.ts`
Added `"ebay.manage": ["super_admin", "admin"]` to `PERMISSION_ROLES`. Used for fine-grained UI gates (action buttons, logs panel write controls).

#### New: `app/api/admin/ebay/logs/route.ts`
GET proxy → `GET /admin/ebay/logs`. Forwards all filter params: `product_id`, `sku`, `action`, `status`, `from`, `to`, `page`, `per_page`. Graceful: returns `{ data: [], meta: {} }` on error if backend not yet deployed.

#### New: `app/api/admin/products/[id]/ebay/refresh-status/route.ts`
POST proxy → `POST /admin/products/{id}/ebay/refresh-status`. Fetches latest eBay listing status from Trading API via backend, returns updated product eBay fields.

#### New: `components/admin/ebay-logs-panel.tsx`
Collapsible "eBay Listing Logs" panel, lazy-loaded on first open (`everLoaded` ref guards the fetch).

**Filter bar:** Action dropdown (publish / publish_failed / remove / remove_failed / sync / sync_failed / refresh_status / refresh_status_failed), SKU text input, date From/To range, Clear + Refresh buttons.

**Table columns:** Action badge | SKU / Product ID | eBay Item ID (linked to ebay.de/itm/…) | Status badge | Error (truncated, full text in `title`) | When (relative).

**Pagination:** 20 per page, prev/next controls.

**Read-only notice:** shown at top when `canManage = false`.

**Graceful:** returns empty state without error if backend endpoint not yet deployed.

#### Updated: `app/admin/ebay/page.tsx`
Full rewrite for EB-2. Key additions on top of EB-1:

- `useAdminPermissions()` hook → `canManage = can("ebay.manage")` gates all mutation buttons
- Extended `EbayStatus` type: `"active" | "draft" | "error" | "ended" | "withdrawn" | "unknown" | null`
- Extended `Product` type with: `ebay_status`, `ebay_offer_id`, `ebay_last_synced_at`, `ebay_sync_error`
- `EbayStatusBadge` sub-component — color-coded pill (active=green, draft=amber, error=red, ended/withdrawn/unknown=gray)
- `fmtSynced()` helper — shows relative time or ISO date for `ebay_last_synced_at`
- New "Last Synced" column in the listing table
- Inline `ebay_sync_error` display in table row (red text, full error in `title`)
- Per-row "Refresh Status" button (RotateCcw icon) — only shown for listed products when `canManage`; calls `/api/admin/products/{id}/ebay/refresh-status` and optimistically updates the row
- Separate `refreshLoading: Set<number>` state (independent from `actionLoading`)
- All action buttons (`toggleEbay`, `handleSync`, bulk list) gated on `canManage` — disabled with tooltip when lacking permission
- Table `min-w-[1020px]` (was 780px) to accommodate 9 columns
- `<EbayLogsPanel>` rendered at page bottom

#### Updated: `components/admin/products-table.tsx`
Replaced the simple "eBay Live" badge in the eBay column with `EbayProductBadge` sub-component:
- Shows status-colored pill: active=green, draft=amber, error=red, ended/withdrawn/unknown=gray
- If `ebay_item_id` present: small `ExternalLink` icon linking to `https://www.ebay.de/itm/{id}`
- If `ebay_sync_error` present: small `AlertCircle` icon (red) with full error text in `title`
- Falls back to "—" if neither `ebay_listed` nor `ebay_status` is set

---

**Backend endpoints required for EB-2 (not yet implemented):**
- `GET /api/v1/admin/ebay/logs` → paginated log entries with `action`, `status`, `ebay_item_id`, `sku`, `product_id`, `error`, `created_at`
- `POST /api/v1/admin/products/{id}/ebay/refresh-status` → fetches live eBay item status and returns updated `{ ebay_status, ebay_item_id, ebay_last_synced_at, ebay_sync_error }`
- Products API must include `ebay_offer_id`, `ebay_last_synced_at`, `ebay_sync_error` in product responses

* **Custom cookie-based customer auth** — `customer_token` httpOnly cookie, proxied Laravel API (NextAuth fully removed)
* Resend (email API — contact and checkout order notification routes; **no longer used for quote requests** — backend owns those emails)
* `tailwind-merge`, `clsx`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, `prettier`

Development environment: Windows 11, VS Code, Node.js / npm

## Completed in Latest Session — SEO Phases 1–3, 4A, 4B + Phase 2C-6 (2026-05-13)

---

### Phase 2C-6 — Admin Logistics Dashboard

**Goal:** Add `/admin/logistics` — a real-time operations view for which orders are ready for shipment, missing trade documents, or pending EU compliance. Frontend only.

**Commits:** `e340113`

#### Updated: `lib/admin-permissions.ts`
- Added `"logistics"` to `ROLE_ACCESS` for: `super_admin`, `admin`, `order_manager`, `sales_manager`, `support`
- Added `"/admin/logistics": "logistics"` to `PATH_SECTION`

#### Updated: `components/admin/admin-shell.tsx`
- Added `Truck` icon (lucide-react)
- Nav item added: `{ label: "Logistics", href: "/admin/logistics", icon: Truck, section: "logistics" }` after EU Declarations

#### New: `app/api/admin/logistics/dashboard/route.ts`
GET proxy → `GET /admin/logistics/dashboard`. Reads `admin_token` cookie, Bearer-authenticates to backend, forwards all query params.

#### New: `app/admin/logistics/page.tsx`
Server wrapper — reads `admin_token` + `admin_role` from cookies; redirects on missing auth; renders `<LogisticsDashboard adminRole={adminRole} />`.

#### New: `components/admin/logistics-dashboard.tsx`
Full `"use client"` component:

**4 summary cards:** Ready for Shipment, Missing Documents, EU Compliance Pending, Completed

**Filter bar:** `status`, `missing_document`, `risk_level`, `reverse_charge_only` checkbox

**Checklist table columns:**
Order ref (linked) | Customer | Country | Status | Payment | Documents (PI/CI/PL/DN/SD pills — emerald=present, red=missing, gray=N/A) | EU Declaration | Risk | Next Action | Generate

**Quick-generate `GenBtn`:** per-row buttons for missing generable docs; calls existing trade-document proxy routes. Gated on `canDo(adminRole, "trade_documents.manage")`.

States: loading skeleton, error banner + retry, empty state, pagination with ellipsis, gen-error toast (auto-dismiss).

---

### SEO Phase 1 — Quote & About Page Optimisation

**Goal:** Meta titles/descriptions, H1s, image alt text, internal link ("International logistics support"), outbound links to Hapag-Lloyd and DB Schenker.

**Commits:** `933d89d`

#### Updated: `app/quote/page.tsx` and `app/about/page.tsx`
- Quote title: `"Get Instant Tyre Supply Quotation With Competitive Prices"`
- About title: `"Get your tires from one of the leading European wholesale tire distributors"`
- Both descriptions updated to include PCR/TBR/used tyres, wholesale, 30+ countries

#### Updated: `lib/translations.ts` (English locale only)

Descriptive `imageAlt` values added for SEO.

#### Updated: `components/quote/quote-summary.tsx`
Internal SEO link added: "International logistics support" → `/wholesale-tire-distributors-europe`

#### Updated: `components/quote/quote-trust.tsx`
Outbound links added: Hapag-Lloyd and DB Schenker as trusted freight partners.

#### Updated: `components/about/logistics-partners.tsx`
Hapag-Lloyd and DB Schenker partner tiles wrapped in `<a href target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`.

---

### SEO Phase 2 — SEO-Friendly URL Aliases with 301 Redirects

**Goal:** Create canonical SEO URLs; 301-redirect old URLs.

**Commits:** `da147c8`

**New canonical routes:**
- `/tyre-supply-quotation` (replaces `/quote`)
- `/wholesale-tire-distributors-europe` (replaces `/about`)

#### New: `app/tyre-supply-quotation/page.tsx`
Full quote page at canonical URL — same component tree as old `/quote`, plus `alternates.canonical` and BreadcrumbList JSON-LD.

#### New: `app/wholesale-tire-distributors-europe/page.tsx`
Full about page at canonical URL — same component tree as old `/about`, plus `alternates.canonical` and BreadcrumbList JSON-LD.

#### Updated: `next.config.ts`
```typescript
async redirects() {
  return [
    { source: "/quote",  destination: "/tyre-supply-quotation",             permanent: true },
    { source: "/about",  destination: "/wholesale-tire-distributors-europe", permanent: true },
  ];
}
```

#### Updated: 25+ files
All internal links updated — `href="/quote"` → `href="/tyre-supply-quotation"` and `href="/about"` → `href="/wholesale-tire-distributors-europe"` across `components/navbar.tsx` (NAV array + mega-menu + special-case `if` check), `components/footer.tsx` (5 entries), and 21 other component and page files.

---

### SEO Phase 3 — Sitemap, Robots.txt, Structured Data & Canonical Cleanup

**Goal:** Technical SEO foundation — sitemap, robots.txt, Organization/WebSite JSON-LD, canonical tags, Google Search Console.

**Commits:** `e9ab6f4`

#### New: `app/robots.ts`
```
Allow: /, /shop, /news, /contact, /fet, /tyre-supply-quotation, /wholesale-tire-distributors-europe
Disallow: /admin, /account, /checkout, /api
Sitemap: https://www.okelcor.com/sitemap.xml
```

#### Updated: `app/sitemap.ts`
- Removed `/quote` and `/about` (both 301 to new canonicals)
- Added `/tyre-supply-quotation` (priority 0.9) and `/wholesale-tire-distributors-europe` (priority 0.8)
- `BASE_URL = "https://www.okelcor.com"` (www form, matches `metadataBase`)

#### Updated: `app/layout.tsx`
- Google site verification injected from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` env var
- **Organization JSON-LD** in `<body>`: name, legalName, url, logo, Munich address, contactPoint, vatID
- **WebSite JSON-LD** in `<body>`: name, url, `potentialAction` SearchAction → `/shop?q={search_term_string}`

#### Updated: `app/shop/page.tsx`, `app/shop/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/news/[slug]/page.tsx`
Added `alternates.canonical` and absolute `openGraph.url` to all `generateMetadata` / static metadata exports.

---

### SEO Phase 4A — 12 New SEO Catalogue Landing Pages

**Goal:** Statically pre-rendered SEO pages for tyre categories, seasons, and brands — each pre-applies a filter to the interactive shop catalogue.

**Commits:** `d58b7da`

#### New: `components/shop/catalogue-landing.tsx`
Shared server component used by all 12 landing pages. `CatalogueLandingConfig` type:
```typescript
{
  eyebrow?: string;
  h1: string;
  intro: string | string[];
  filters: Record<string, string>;
  breadcrumbSchema: object;
  popularSizes?: { label: string; href: string }[];
  faq?: { q: string; a: string }[];
  relatedGroups?: { heading: string; links: RelatedLink[] }[];
}
```
Renders: BreadcrumbList + FAQPage JSON-LD → H1 section → `ShopPageClient` (pre-filtered, `source="seo-landing"`) → Popular Sizes chips → FAQ accordion → Related links grid.

#### Updated: `components/shop/shop-page-client.tsx`
- Added `noNavbarPad?: boolean` — skips internal navbar padding offset so `CatalogueLanding` controls clearance
- Added `source?: "shop" | "seo-landing"` — passed through to `ShopCatalogue`

#### Updated: `components/shop/shop-catalogue.tsx`
- Added `source?: "shop" | "seo-landing"` (default `"shop"`)
- Campaign banner (`ShopCampaignBanner`) + Rapid Specials list (`SpecialsProductList`) gated on `source !== "seo-landing"` — hidden on SEO landing pages so filtered results are primary content. `/shop` behaviour unchanged.

#### New: 12 static page routes (all pre-rendered as `○ Static`):

| URL | Filter | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `/passenger-tires` | `type=PCR` | 0.85 |
| `/light-truck-tires` | `type=TBR` | 0.85 |
| `/summer-tires` | `season=Summer` | 0.80 |
| `/winter-tires` | `season=Winter` | 0.80 |
| `/all-season-tires` | `season=All Season` | 0.80 |
| `/michelin-tires` | `brand=Michelin` | 0.75 |
| `/bridgestone-tires` | `brand=Bridgestone` | 0.75 |
| `/continental-tires` | `brand=Continental` | 0.75 |
| `/pirelli-tires` | `brand=Pirelli` | 0.75 |
| `/goodyear-tires` | `brand=Goodyear` | 0.75 |
| `/dunlop-tires` | `brand=Dunlop` | 0.75 |
| `/falken-tires` | `brand=Falken` | 0.75 |

All 12 routes added to `app/sitemap.ts`.

---

### SEO Phase 4B — Content Depth for All 12 Catalogue Landing Pages

**Goal:** Strengthen all SEO landing pages against thin-content issues; add unique useful content while keeping the product grid near the top.

**Commits:** `5019e5d`

**All 12 page files fully rewritten.** Each page now has:

1. **Multi-paragraph intro (150–250 words)** — unique per page; covers product category/brand context, wholesale/export/logistics relevance, target markets
2. **Popular Sizes section** — 6–7 clickable chips linking to pre-filtered shop searches:
   - Category pages: `/shop?type=PCR&size=205%2F55R16`
   - Season pages: `/shop?season=Summer&size=205%2F55R16`
   - Brand pages: `/shop?brand=Michelin&size=205%2F55R16`
3. **FAQ section** — 4–5 questions per page, unique by page type:
   - Category FAQs: definitions, MOQ, brands, used tyres, documentation
   - Season FAQs: temperature range, regulations, stocking windows, 3PMSF vs M+S
   - Brand FAQs: manufacturer origin, quality tier, popular models, TBR availability, export markets
4. **FAQPage JSON-LD** — auto-built from the `faq` array inside `CatalogueLanding`, injected as a second `<script type="application/ld+json">` alongside BreadcrumbList
5. **Internal links** — every page links to: quote page (`/tyre-supply-quotation`), full shop, related categories, seasons, and brands

**Rendering order per page:**
SEO hero (H1 + intro) → Product filter/grid → Popular Sizes → FAQ → Internal links

**TypeScript: 0 errors | Build: clean, 97 pages, all 12 pages `○ Static`**

## Completed in Latest Session — Phase 2C-5: Send Trade Documents by Email (2026-05-13)

---

### Phase 2C-5 — Send Trade Documents by Email

**Goal:** Allow admins to email any trade document (generated or uploaded) directly from the order detail Trade Documents card.

#### New: `app/api/admin/trade-documents/[id]/send-email/route.ts`
POST proxy → `POST /api/v1/admin/trade-documents/{id}/send-email`
- Reads `admin_token` cookie, Bearer-authenticates to backend
- Forwards JSON body `{ recipient_email?, message? }` to backend unchanged
- Returns raw Laravel response

#### Updated: `components/admin/trade-documents-card.tsx`
Full rewrite with send-email features:

**New props:**
- `customerEmail?: string` — prefills recipient field in the modal

**New state:**
- `sendModal: SendModal | null` — when set, the modal is open for that document
- `toast: string | null` — auto-clears after 4 s via `useEffect`

**New `SendModal` type:**
```typescript
type SendModal = {
  doc: TradeDocument;
  recipientEmail: string;
  message: string;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
};
```

**`SendBtn` inner component:** renders "Send" or "Send again" (based on `doc.sent_at`) with a `Mail` icon. Visible to `canManage` roles only. Opens the modal.

**`handleSendEmail`:** POSTs to `/api/admin/trade-documents/{id}/send-email`. On success: updates `sent_at` on the matching document in local state, closes modal, shows toast. On failure: shows inline error inside modal.

**Per-row UI changes:**
- Generated docs: `<ActionBtn>` and `<SendBtn>` in a flex row per document
- Shipment docs: `<SendBtn>` added to the action button group; `sent_at` shown in the date line

**Send Email Modal (inline fixed overlay):**
- Backdrop click closes modal (when not loading)
- Shows document name + number/label
- Recipient email input (pre-filled with `customerEmail`, editable)
- Optional note textarea (1000 char max with live counter)
- Inline error display
- "Send Document" button disabled when recipient email is empty or loading
- Cancel button disabled when loading

**Toast:**
- Fixed bottom-right, emerald green with `CheckCircle2` icon
- Auto-dismisses after 4 seconds

#### Updated: `components/admin/order-detail.tsx`
- Passes `customerEmail={order.customer_email}` to `TradeDocumentsCard`

**Backend requirements (2C-5):**
- `POST /api/v1/admin/trade-documents/{id}/send-email`
  - Auth: `admin_token` Bearer
  - Permission: `trade_documents.manage`
  - Body: `{ recipient_email?: string, message?: string }`
  - Validates: `recipient_email` nullable|email, `message` nullable|string|max:1000
  - Sends email with document attached (from `pdf_path` or `file_path`)
  - Updates `sent_at = now()` on the `trade_documents` record
  - Logs `OrderLog: action=document_sent`
  - Returns: `{ data: { id, sent_at, recipient_email }, message: "Document sent successfully." }`
  - Failures: 404 if file missing, 500 + log on mail failure

**TypeScript: 0 errors**

---

## Completed in Latest Session — Phase 2C-4: Commercial Invoice Frontend (2026-05-13)

---

### Phase 2C-4 — Commercial Invoice / Export Invoice

**Goal:** Surface the Commercial Invoice as an export/trade document distinct from the accounting/tax invoice. Commercial Invoice is generated by admins and viewed by both admin and customer as inline PDF.

#### New: `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/trade-documents/commercial-invoice/route.ts`
POST proxy → `POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/generate-commercial-invoice`
- Reads `admin_token` cookie, Bearer-authenticates to backend
- Returns raw Laravel response (idempotent — backend returns existing doc if already issued)

#### Updated: `components/admin/trade-documents-card.tsx`
- Added `"commercial_invoice"` to `INLINE_GENERATED` — opens as "View" in new tab (not force-download)
- Added `TYPE_DESCRIPTION` map: short subtitle per generated doc type for UX clarity:
  - `proforma_invoice` → "Pre-shipment estimate"
  - `commercial_invoice` → "Export / trade document"
  - `packing_list` → "Goods enumeration for customs"
  - `delivery_note` → "Delivery confirmation"
- Added `commercial` GenerateState + `hasCommercialInv` derived state
- Added purple "Generate Commercial Invoice" button (`border-purple-200 bg-purple-50 text-purple-700`) — hidden once doc exists; RBAC-gated on `trade_documents.manage`
- Added `commercial.error` error display line
- Each generated doc row now shows `TYPE_DESCRIPTION[doc.type]` as a small grey subtitle between the doc name and the issued date

**Button colour scheme:**
| Doc | Colour |
|---|---|
| Proforma Invoice | Orange |
| Commercial Invoice | Purple |
| Packing List | Blue |
| Delivery Note | Teal |

#### Updated: `components/account/trade-documents-card.tsx`
- Added `TYPE_DESCRIPTION` map (same values as admin)
- Shows description as a small `text-[0.68rem]` subtitle below document type name in each trade doc row
- `"commercial_invoice"` was already in `INLINE_GENERATED` and `TYPE_LABEL` — customer sees "View PDF" automatically once backend sends the document
- No gating applied to commercial invoice — it is never locked behind EU certificate requirement

**UX distinction enforced:**
- `commercial_invoice` → "Export / trade document" (trade documents section)
- Tax/accounting invoice → separate `/account/invoices` page (untouched)

**TypeScript: 0 errors**

**Backend requirement (2C-4):**
- `POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/generate-commercial-invoice` — generates PDF from `commercial-invoice.blade.php` view, saves as `type = commercial_invoice`, `status = issued`, `number = CI-YYYY-NNNN`. Idempotent. Logs `document_generated` event. Customer endpoint must include `commercial_invoice` in `trade_documents` array.

---

## Completed in Latest Session — Security Dashboard, Bugfixes & Trade Document Suite Phases 2C-1 → 2C-3 (2026-05-12)

---

### Security Dashboard UI — Phase 2B (continued)

**Goal:** Complete the admin security dashboard with metric cards, login history table, and events log filters.

#### New: `components/admin/security-metrics.tsx`
Five KPI metric cards rendered at the top of `/admin/security`:
- **2FA Adoption %** — computed from `twoFaUsers` array (`enabled / total × 100`); colour-coded green ≥80%, amber ≥50%, red <50%
- **Failed Logins Today** — from `summary.failed_logins_today`
- **Blocked Admin Actions** — from `summary.blocked_admin_actions`; "Not tracked" when field absent
- **Webhook Failures** — from `summary.webhook_failures`; "Not tracked" when field absent
- **Active Admin Sessions** — from `summary.active_admin_sessions`; "Not tracked" when field absent

#### New: `components/admin/security-login-history.tsx`
Self-fetching table: `GET /api/admin/security/login-history`

Columns: Admin (name/email), IP + location, Device/Browser (parsed from UA string), Time, Status badge, 2FA indicator.

- `parseDevice(ua)` and `parseBrowser(ua)` helpers
- Status badges: `success` → emerald, `failed` → red, `2fa_required` → amber
- Date-range filter (from/to inputs) with Clear button
- Pagination with chevron + page number buttons
- Graceful unavailable/empty/loading states

#### New: `app/api/admin/security/login-history/route.ts`
GET proxy → `GET /admin/security/login-history` with optional query params. Treats 404/403 as `{ _unavailable: true }` instead of error.

#### Updated: `app/admin/security/page.tsx`
- Replaced static `StatCard` grid with `<SecurityMetrics summary={summary} twoFaUsers={twoFaUsers} />`
- Added `<SecurityLoginHistory />` between adoption table and system-wide sections
- Added severity chip filter bar + date range inputs inside events log card
- `fetchEvents` useCallback updated to read severity/date from closure deps and forward as query params
- `Summary` type extended: `blocked_admin_actions?`, `webhook_failures?`, `active_admin_sessions?`

---

### Bugfix — Admin 2FA Login Challenge Shows "Server Error"

**Problem:** `submitAdminTwoFactor` in `app/admin/actions.ts` returned the raw Laravel `json.message` string for all status codes — including 500 errors which sent generic internal messages to the UI.

**Fix:** Status-code-specific error mapping in `app/admin/actions.ts`:
| Status | Message shown |
|---|---|
| 5xx | "A server error occurred during verification. Please try again, or contact support if this persists." |
| 429 | "Too many attempts. Please wait a moment and try again." |
| 419 | "Session expired. Please sign in again." |
| 422 + "session" in message | "Your 2FA session has expired. Please sign in again." |
| 422 + "not configured" | "2FA is not configured on this account. Contact your super admin." |
| 422 other | Raw `message` or "Invalid or expired code. Please try again." |
| other | Raw `message` or "Verification failed. Please try again." |

Also fixed `API_URL` in `actions.ts`: `process.env.API_URL ?? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL ??`.

---

### Bugfix — Admin Dashboard Analytics Flickering / Disappearing

**Problem:** Dashboard data wiped to zero on every failed background refresh; blank areas shown instead of keeping stale data.

#### Updated: `components/admin/dashboard/hero-metrics.tsx`
- Added `hasData = useRef(false)` — tracks whether at least one successful fetch has completed
- `refresh(background = false)` — background refreshes set `stale=true` and preserve previous `m` on failure; only first-load failure sets `fetchErr=true` and shows error banner
- JSX guards: `loading && m === null` → skeleton; `m === null && fetchErr` → error banner with Retry button; else → cards with `opacity-60` when stale

#### Updated: `components/admin/dashboard/recent-orders.tsx`
Added explicit `orders === null` branch: "Could not load orders. [Retry]" button.

#### Updated: `components/admin/dashboard/revenue-chart.tsx`
Added `data === null` branch: "Chart data unavailable." in 180px container. Legend only shown when `data !== null`.

#### Bulk fix — 30 admin proxy routes
All `app/api/admin/**/*.ts` routes that used `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` without the private `API_URL` fallback were updated:
```ts
// Before
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL ?? "http://localhost:8000/api/v1"

// After
process.env.API_URL ?? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL ?? "http://localhost:8000/api/v1"
```
**Rule:** All server-side proxy routes must use `API_URL` first (private env var, not exposed to browser). `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is fallback only.

---

### Phase 2C-1 — Packing List System

**Commits:** `d7caa08`

#### Updated: `lib/admin-permissions.ts`
```typescript
"trade_documents.manage": ["super_admin", "admin", "order_manager"],
```

#### New: `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/trade-documents/packing-list/route.ts`
POST proxy → `POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/generate-packing-list`. Returns `{ data: TradeDocument }`.

#### Updated: `components/admin/trade-documents-card.tsx`
- Imports `useAdminPermissions` hook; gates all generate buttons on `can("trade_documents.manage")`
- Added `hasPacking` check and "Generate Packing List" button (blue pill; hidden once doc exists)
- `packing_list` type opens via **View PDF** link (`<a target="_blank">`) — not force-downloaded
- `INLINE_TYPES = new Set(["packing_list", "delivery_note"])` established

#### Updated: `components/account/trade-documents-card.tsx`
`packing_list` added to `INLINE_TYPES` — customer sees "View PDF" instead of "Download".

**Backend confirmed:** Endpoint lives at exactly `POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/generate-packing-list`. Returns `status: "issued"` immediately. Calling twice returns the existing document (idempotent).

---

### Phase 2C-2 — Delivery Note + Delivery Confirmation

**Commits:** `4255f03`

#### New: `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/trade-documents/delivery-note/route.ts`
POST proxy → `POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/generate-delivery-note`.

#### Updated: `lib/admin-api.ts`
`delivery_note` added to `TradeDocument.type` union.

#### Updated: `components/admin/trade-documents-card.tsx`
- `delivery_note` added to `TYPE_LABEL` and `INLINE_TYPES`
- `hasDeliveryNote` check; "Generate Delivery Note" button (teal pill; hidden once doc exists)

#### Updated: `components/account/trade-documents-card.tsx`
- `delivery_note` added to `TYPE_LABEL` and `INLINE_TYPES`

#### New: `components/account/delivery-confirmation-card.tsx`
Shown on customer order detail when `order.status === "delivered"`.

Two variants:
| Condition | Card shown |
|---|---|
| EU reverse-charge + declaration pending | Amber: "Delivery Confirmation Required — complete the EU Entry Certificate below" |
| Non-EU, or cert already signed/acknowledged | Green: "Order Delivered — delivery note available in your documents below" |

#### Updated: `app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx`
`<DeliveryConfirmationCard>` inserted above the EU Entry Certificate card, conditional on `order.status === "delivered"`.

**Backend note:** The backend's customer order endpoint (`GET /api/v1/orders/{ref}`) must include `delivery_note` type documents in the `trade_documents` array. Currently backend filters them out for customers.

---

### Phase 2C-3 — Shipment Document Uploads

**Commits:** `0c681cf`

#### New: `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/trade-documents/upload/route.ts`
POST proxy — reads `FormData` from client request, forwards multipart directly to `POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/trade-documents/upload`. Does NOT set `Content-Type` manually — lets fetch auto-set boundary.

#### New: `app/api/admin/trade-documents/[id]/route.ts`
DELETE proxy → `DELETE /api/v1/admin/trade-documents/{id}`. Returns 204 cleanly.

#### Updated: `lib/admin-api.ts`
```typescript
export type TradeDocument = {
  // ...existing fields...
  type: "proforma_invoice" | "commercial_invoice" | "packing_list"
      | "delivery_note" | "shipment_document" | "other" | string;
  document_label?: string | null;   // admin-chosen label at upload
  notes?: string | null;
  file_size?: number | null;
  mime_type?: string | null;
};
```

#### Updated: `components/admin/trade-documents-card.tsx`
Full rewrite with upload and delete support.

**Upload panel** (toggled by "Upload Document" button — RBAC-gated):
- Document type dropdown: Bill of Lading, CMR, Air Waybill, Customs Document, Certificate of Origin, Proof of Delivery, Other
- Optional notes input
- File picker with client-side validation: allowed extensions `pdf, jpg, jpeg, png, xls, xlsx, csv`; max 10 MB
- `fmtSize()` helper for human-readable file sizes
- On success: appends returned `TradeDocument` to local state; resets form and closes panel

**Shipment document list** (separate section below generated docs):
- Shows: `document_label`, filename, file size, upload date, optional notes
- `canViewInline(doc)` helper — returns true for PDF/JPG/PNG by file extension; false for XLS/CSV → force-download
- Delete: icon button → inline "Delete / Cancel" row (no browser confirm); removes from state on `204`/`200`
- RBAC-gated; generated PDFs (proforma/packing/delivery/commercial) cannot be deleted from UI

**`canViewInline()` logic:**
```typescript
function canViewInline(doc: TradeDocument): boolean {
  if (INLINE_GENERATED.has(doc.type)) return true;
  if (doc.type === "shipment_document") {
    const ext = fileExt(doc.original_filename);
    return ext === "pdf" || ext === "jpg" || ext === "jpeg" || ext === "png";
  }
  return false;
}
```

#### Updated: `components/account/trade-documents-card.tsx`
Split into two visual sections:
- **Documents** — all non-`shipment_document` types (generated PDFs)
- **Shipment Documents** — `shipment_document` entries; shows `document_label`, filename, size, date; View (inline) for PDF/images, Download for spreadsheets

`shipment_document` added to `TYPE_LABEL`.

**Backend requirements (Phase 2C-3):**
- `POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/trade-documents/upload` — accepts multipart, saves to `storage/app/private/trade-documents/uploads/{order_ref}/`, returns `{ data: TradeDocument }` with all fields including `document_label`, `file_size`, `mime_type`
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/trade-documents/{id}` — only allows deletion of `shipment_document` type; returns `204 No Content`
- Customer order endpoint must include `shipment_document` records in `trade_documents` array

TypeScript checks: **0 errors** across all commits.

## Completed in Latest Session — Shop Fixes, Incoterms Overhaul & FOB Default (2026-05-11)

---

### Rapid Specials Layout Fix + CTA Split

**Commits:** `bfa332f`

**Problem:** Campaign banner CTA was both triggering a brand-filtered search AND scrolling to results — making it behave like the "View All" button on the specials header, which confused UX intent.

**Fix — `components/shop/shop-catalogue.tsx`:**
- Added `handleScrollToSpecials` — scroll-only, no search trigger:
  ```tsx
  const handleScrollToSpecials = useCallback(() => {
    document.getElementById("specials-section")?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" });
  }, []);
  ```
- Campaign banner `onCtaClick` now receives `handleScrollToSpecials` (scroll to specials) instead of `handleCampaignCta` (brand filter + search)
- Specials header "View All" still uses `handleCampaignCta` — applies brand filter, triggers search, scrolls to `#catalogue-results`
- Added `id="catalogue-results"` to the results `<div>` so the scroll target exists
- Reordered JSX: filter bar → campaign banner + specials → inline promo strip → results
- Removed 5 debug `console.log` calls across promotions and specials fetch effects

---

### Remove Client-Side Discount Calculation from Specials List

**Commit:** `b2a20a7`

**Problem:** `components/shop/specials-product-list.tsx` was calculating a crossed-out "original" price using `price / (1 - discountPct / 100)`. The backend `price` field already reflects the discounted price — this formula was fabricating a fake original price.

**Fix:**
- Removed `discountPct` prop from `SpecialRow` interface
- Removed crossed-out price block from desktop row render
- Removed crossed-out price block from mobile card render
- Removed `discountPct={discountPct}` from `products.map()` call
- Result: prices display exactly as returned by API; `discount_pct` is used only for the `"X% OFF"` badge

**Rule going forward:** `discount_pct` is badge-only. All prices are final as returned by the API. Never compute `price × (1 - discount_pct / 100)` on the frontend.

---

### Tyre Placeholder — Replaced PNG with SVG Silhouette

**Commit:** `aad419c`

**Problem:** `public/images/tyre-placeholder.png` contained a photo of a van with shipping containers — entirely wrong for a product card placeholder in a tyre catalogue.

**Fix:**
- Created `public/images/tyre-placeholder.svg` — front-view tyre silhouette
  - Structure: white background, outer tyre (`r=90`, `#1a1a1a`), tread block pattern (dashed stroke `r=81` `dasharray="14 7"`), groove rings, sidewall (`r=69`, `#212121`), grey rim (`r=55`, `#c3c5c8`), 5 spokes at `-90°/−18°/54°/126°/198°`, hub circles
- Updated placeholder constant reference from `.png` → `.svg` in:
  - `components/shop/product-card.tsx`
  - `components/shop/product-gallery.tsx`
  - `components/shop/related-products.tsx`
  - `lib/utils.ts` (`getProductImageUrl` fallback)

---

### Products Proxy — Cache-Control: no-store Fix

**Commit:** `735b88b`

**Problem:** `app/api/shop/products/route.ts` used `cache: "no-store"` on the upstream `fetch()` (Next.js Data Cache), but the `NextResponse` had no `Cache-Control` header. Vercel's edge/CDN could still cache the response and serve stale prices.

**Fix:**
```ts
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
// ...
response.headers.set("Cache-Control", "no-store");
```
- `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` — forces route to opt out of static rendering
- `response.headers.set("Cache-Control", "no-store")` — instructs edge/CDN not to cache the response
- Also removed 3 debug `console.log` calls from the route handler

---

### FOB-First Incoterms Overhaul

**Commit:** `1491934`

**Business rule:** FOB Germany is Okelcor's default shipping term for international orders. CIF was incorrectly used as the default across payment documents, checkout UI, and the quote form.

**Changes:**

#### `lib/utils.ts` — `formatIncoterm()` utility (new)
Single source of truth for all incoterm display formatting:
```ts
export function formatIncoterm(value: string | null | undefined): string {
  if (!value) return "Incoterms 2020: FOB Germany unless otherwise agreed in writing.";
  if (value === "CIF") return "Incoterms 2020: CIF destination port — freight and insurance included to destination port.";
  if (value === "Custom") return "Custom shipping arrangement — to be confirmed in quotation.";
  return `Incoterms 2020: ${value}`;
}
```

#### `components/account/bank-transfer-details.tsx`
- Removed hardcoded `{ label: "Delivery Term", value: "CIF" }` row
- Added optional `incoterm?: string | null` prop
- Dynamic `deliveryRow` built from `formatIncoterm(incoterm)` — label: "Delivery / Shipping Terms"
- Inserted between Bank Address row and Payment Terms row

#### `components/checkout/checkout-flow.tsx`
- Bank transfer payment option subtitle: `"CIF · 50% on confirmation…"` → `"FOB · 50% on confirmation, balance on B/L"`

#### `components/quote/quote-form.tsx`
- Converted `EU_INCOTERMS` and `INT_INCOTERMS` from plain string arrays to `{ value, label }` object arrays:
  ```ts
  const EU_INCOTERMS = [
    { value: "DAP", label: "DAP" },
    { value: "DDP", label: "DDP" },
    { value: "EXW", label: "EXW" },
  ] as const;
  const INT_INCOTERMS = [
    { value: "FOB",    label: "FOB" },
    { value: "CIF",    label: "CIF" },
    { value: "Custom", label: "Custom shipping arrangement" },
  ] as const;
  ```
- Select `<option value={opt.value}>{opt.label}</option>` — submitted value is raw (`"Custom"`), displayed label is human-readable (`"Custom shipping arrangement"`)
- Added helper text under the select for CIF, Custom, and empty non-EU state

#### `components/admin/quote-detail.tsx`
- Imports `formatIncoterm` from `@/lib/utils`
- Incoterm `InfoRow` now displays `formatIncoterm(quote.incoterm)` instead of raw value

---

### Incoterm Value Alignment Fix

**Commit:** `63517ef`

**Problem:** Frontend was submitting `"Custom shipping arrangement"` as the `incoterm` value. Backend accepts only the raw string `"Custom"`. The `{ value, label }` refactor above (commit `1491934`) fixed this — `option value="Custom"` is submitted while `"Custom shipping arrangement"` is only the display label.

**Verification:** Confirmed with `git grep` exhaustive search — no `price × (1 - discount_pct / 100)` formula exists anywhere in the codebase. All price calculations are `product.price × quantity` only.

---

### Price Audit Confirmation (No Code Changes)

Three exhaustive `git grep` searches confirmed:
- No `price * (1 - discount` formula exists in any file
- No `price × (1 - discount` formula exists in any file
- `resolvePrice()` performs field selection only (`price_b2b ?? price`, etc.) — no arithmetic
- Cart context subtotal: pure `price × quantity`
- Checkout order summary: pure `price × quantity`

The `discount_pct` field is used exclusively for badge display (`"35% OFF"`). Backend returns final discounted prices in the `price` field.

---

### "Delivery Term: CIF" Root Cause (No Frontend Code Change Needed)

**Investigation:** After the incoterms overhaul commits, the checkout page still appeared to show "Delivery Term: CIF" on the live server.

**Root cause:** The server had not run `git pull` after commit `63517ef`. The stale build was serving the old code. No frontend code change was needed.

**Confirmed by exhaustive grep:**
- No hardcoded `"Delivery Term"` label in any rendered component
- No raw `"CIF"` value in any rendered output
- All incoterm display now routes through `formatIncoterm()` or the `bank-transfer-details.tsx` dynamic row

**Resolution:** Run `git pull && npm run build && pm2 restart` (or equivalent) on the Namecheap server.

---

### Backend Changes Required (from this session)

None — all changes are frontend only. Backend must:
1. Return `price` as the final discounted price (already confirmed doing this)
2. Accept `"Custom"` (not `"Custom shipping arrangement"`) as the incoterm value (already the case)
3. Pass `incoterm` field on orders to the frontend so `BankTransferDetails` can display the correct delivery term per-order

---

## Completed in Latest Session — Phase 2C + Bugfixes (2026-05-08)

---

### Phase 2B-5 (continued) — Compliance Metrics Strip on Admin EU Declaration Detail

**Commits:** `445030f`, `fd341c1`

#### Updated: `app/admin/eu-declarations/[id]/page.tsx`

**New fields added to `EuDeclarationFull` type:**
```typescript
reminder_count?: number | null;
last_reminder_at?: string | null;
```

**New `computeUrgency()` helper:**
Derives one of five urgency levels from backend fields:
| Urgency | Condition |
|---|---|
| `done` | `status === "acknowledged"` OR `admin_acknowledged_at` is set |
| `signed` | `status === "signed"` |
| `critical` | `status === "pending"` and 30+ days since creation |
| `overdue` | `status === "pending"` and 14–30 days since creation |
| `normal` | `status === "pending"` and under 14 days |

`admin_acknowledged_at` is used as the primary source of truth — if the backend sets the timestamp without updating the status column, the strip still shows "done" correctly.

**New `ComplianceStrip` server sub-component:**
Four metric tiles rendered between `EuDeclarationActions` and the 2-column data grid:
- **Days Pending** — large coloured number; `Clock`/`AlertTriangle` badge for overdue/critical
- **Reminders Sent** — count or "—"
- **Last Reminder** — date or "—"
- **Compliance State** — coloured badge + description sentence

Urgency colour map:
| Urgency | Border/bg | Badge | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| normal | sky | sky | "Pending — within the 14-day window" |
| overdue | amber | amber | "Pending — customer has not responded within 14 days" |
| critical | red | red | "Pending — 30+ days without a customer signature" |
| signed | blue | blue | "Awaiting Acknowledgement — admin review needed" |
| done | emerald | emerald | "Compliance Completed — acknowledged by admin" |

---

### Bugfix — Acknowledged State Not Reflecting After PATCH

**Commit:** `fd341c1`

**Root cause:** `EuDeclarationActions` tracked only `status` in local state. The backend may set `admin_acknowledged_at` without atomically changing the `status` column. On page reload, `initialStatus` was still `"signed"`, so the Acknowledge button reappeared and the banner stayed blue even though the declaration was acknowledged.

**Fix:**
- Added `initialAcknowledgedAt` prop to `EuDeclarationActions`
- Added `adminAcknowledgedAt` local state, synced from `initialAcknowledgedAt` via `useEffect`
- After successful PATCH: sets both `status = "acknowledged"` AND `adminAcknowledgedAt = new Date().toISOString()`
- `isAcknowledged = status === "acknowledged" || adminAcknowledgedAt != null` — either field is sufficient
- `effectiveStatus` forced to `"acknowledged"` when `isAcknowledged` is true — drives banner + badge
- `canAcknowledge = !isAcknowledged && status === "signed"` — button hidden when either condition met
- `computeUrgency()` in `page.tsx` updated to treat `admin_acknowledged_at` as source of truth for "done" urgency

**Updated LABEL for acknowledged banner:**
`"Acknowledged — compliance review completed."`

**Props change:**
```typescript
// Before
{ id, initialStatus, orderRef }

// After
{ id, initialStatus, initialAcknowledgedAt?: string | null, orderRef }
```

---

### Phase 2C-1 — Trade Document Audit (No Code Changes)

Audit of the existing invoice/document experience identified:

**What existed:**
- `/account/invoices` — invoice list with PDF download; no gating on order/declaration status
- Customer order detail — no invoice download; only EU Certificate card + new `TradeDocumentsCard`
- Admin order detail — no document generation or upload UI
- `app/api/account/invoices/[id]/download/route.ts` — customer invoice proxy (existed)
- `Invoice` type has no `declaration_required` or `declaration_status` fields

**Key gaps identified:**
- No proforma invoice generation
- No commercial invoice generation
- No document gating based on delivery or certificate status
- `TradeDocumentsCard` was not yet connected to order state

---

### Phase 2C-2 — Trade Documents UI + Proforma Invoice

**Commit:** `ca44d92`

#### Updated: `lib/admin-api.ts`

New `TradeDocument` type:
```typescript
export type TradeDocument = {
  id: number;
  type: "proforma_invoice" | "commercial_invoice" | "packing_list" | "other" | string;
  number?: string | null;
  status: "draft" | "issued" | "sent" | string;
  issued_at?: string | null;
  sent_at?: string | null;
  original_filename?: string | null;
};
```

`AdminOrderFull` updated:
```typescript
trade_documents?: TradeDocument[];
```

#### Updated: `app/account/orders/page.tsx`

`Order` type updated:
```typescript
trade_documents?: TradeDocument[];
```
Imports `TradeDocument` from `@/lib/admin-api`.

#### New: `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/trade-documents/proforma/route.ts`
POST proxy → `POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/trade-documents/proforma`. Requires `admin_token` cookie.

#### New: `app/api/admin/trade-documents/[id]/download/route.ts`
GET proxy → `GET /api/v1/admin/trade-documents/{id}/download`. Requires `admin_token` cookie. Streams binary PDF with preserved `Content-Type` + `Content-Disposition`.

#### New: `app/api/account/trade-documents/[id]/download/route.ts`
GET proxy → `GET /api/v1/auth/trade-documents/{id}/download`. Requires `customer_token` cookie.

#### New: `components/admin/trade-documents-card.tsx`
`"use client"` component rendered on admin order detail between Order Summary and EU Entry Certificate.

- When no proforma exists: orange "Generate Proforma Invoice" button — POSTs to proxy, appends returned document to local state immediately (no page reload)
- Once proforma exists: generate button hidden
- Each document row: `FileText` icon, type label, `#number` (mono), status badge, issued date, Download button
- Status badges: `draft` = grey, `issued` = blue, `sent` = emerald
- Download: `fetch → blob → createObjectURL → <a>.click()`

#### New: `components/account/trade-documents-card.tsx`
`"use client"` component rendered on customer order detail.

- Accepts `documents`, `declarationRequired`, `declarationStatus` props
- Customer cannot generate documents — download only
- Each document row: type label, number, issued date, Download button
- Section hidden entirely when backend does not return `trade_documents` field (`undefined`)
- Shows "No documents have been issued yet." when array is empty

#### Updated: `components/admin/order-detail.tsx`
Imports and renders `TradeDocumentsCard` with `orderId={order.id}` and `initialDocuments={order.trade_documents ?? []}`.

#### Updated: `app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx`
Passes `declarationRequired` and `declarationStatus` to customer `TradeDocumentsCard`.

---

### EU Reverse-Charge Invoice Visibility Gating

**Commit:** `b1a7b8d`

**Business rule:** For EU B2B reverse-charge orders, final invoice only available after EU Entry Certificate is signed.

#### Updated: `components/account/entry-certificate-card.tsx`

**Pending state (form header)** — added below the §17a UStDV explanation:
> "Your final invoice will become available after this certificate is signed."

**Signed state** — added after the Download Certificate button:
> "Your final invoice is now available in [Invoices](/account/invoices)."

**Acknowledged state** — same invoice link added.

#### Updated: `components/account/trade-documents-card.tsx`

New gating logic for `commercial_invoice` and `final_invoice` document types:
```typescript
const GATED_TYPES = new Set(["commercial_invoice", "final_invoice"]);

function isLocked(doc: TradeDocument): boolean {
  if (!declarationRequired) return false;
  if (!GATED_TYPES.has(doc.type)) return false;
  return declarationStatus !== "signed" && declarationStatus !== "acknowledged";
}
```

When `isLocked(doc)` is true: Download button replaced with a grey lock chip:
```
🔒 Requires certificate
```

**Proforma invoices and packing lists are never locked.**

---

### Bugfix — EU Entry Certificate Showing Too Early

**Commit:** `6f3fd2a`

**Problem:** After placing a bank transfer order (payment pending, status pending), the EU Entry Certificate form appeared immediately — before payment and before delivery.

**Fix:**

#### Updated: `components/account/entry-certificate-card.tsx`

Two new props added to `Props`:
```typescript
paymentStatus?: string | null;
orderStatus?: string | null;
```

Two new early-return info cards inserted between the signed/acknowledged states and the full form render:

**Payment not confirmed** (`paymentStatus !== "paid"`):
```
EU Entry Certificate
Complete payment first. The EU Entry Certificate will be requested after delivery.
```
Style: neutral grey `bg-[#efefef]` — does not compete with the payment card above.

**Paid but not yet delivered** (`orderStatus !== "delivered"`):
```
EU Entry Certificate
After delivery, you will be asked to confirm receipt for VAT compliance.
```
Style: same neutral grey.

**Backward compatibility:** Guards only fire when the backend returns these fields. If `paymentStatus === undefined` or `orderStatus === undefined`, the guards are skipped and the form renders as before.

**Final visibility state machine:**
| Condition | What customer sees |
|---|---|
| `declaration_required !== true` | Nothing rendered |
| `declaration_status === "acknowledged"` | Green confirmed card + certificate download + invoice link |
| `declaration_status === "signed"` | Green submitted card + certificate download + invoice link |
| `paymentStatus` defined and not `"paid"` | Grey info: "Complete payment first…" |
| `paymentStatus === "paid"` and `orderStatus` defined and not `"delivered"` | Grey info: "After delivery, you will be asked…" |
| `paymentStatus === "paid"` and `orderStatus === "delivered"` | Full amber certificate form |
| Backend omits `paymentStatus`/`orderStatus` | Guards skipped — full form shown |

#### Updated: `app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx`

```tsx
<EntryCertificateCard
  orderRef={order.ref}
  orderCountry={order.country}
  status={order.declaration_status}
  signedAt={order.declaration_signed_at}
  signedName={order.declaration_signed_name}
  paymentStatus={order.payment_status}   {/* NEW */}
  orderStatus={order.status}             {/* NEW */}
/>
```

---

### Backend Changes Required (Laravel — Phase 2C)

#### Trade Documents

```
POST   /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/trade-documents/proforma
GET    /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/trade-documents
GET    /api/v1/admin/trade-documents/{id}/download
GET    /api/v1/auth/orders/{ref}/trade-documents
GET    /api/v1/auth/trade-documents/{id}/download
```

Response shape for `trade-documents` list/single:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "type": "proforma_invoice",
    "number": "PRO-2025-0042",
    "status": "issued",
    "issued_at": "2026-05-08T10:00:00Z",
    "sent_at": null,
    "original_filename": "Proforma-PRO-2025-0042.pdf"
  }
}
```

Trade documents must also be embedded in the order detail response:
```json
{ "data": { ...order fields..., "trade_documents": [...] } }
```

#### Certificate Timing

Customer order detail response (`GET /api/v1/orders/{ref}`) must include:
- `payment_status` — required for certificate gating
- `status` — already present; must be `"delivered"` before certificate form is shown
- `declaration_required` — already present
- `declaration_status` — already present

Backend must NOT mark the declaration as actionable until order is delivered. The frontend enforces this visually; the backend must enforce it at the API level.

#### Invoice Release

Commercial invoice `released_at` must be set when `declaration_status` transitions to `"signed"`. The `/auth/invoices` endpoint must omit unreleased invoices. The `/auth/trade-documents/{id}/download` endpoint must reject downloads while `released_at` is null.

TypeScript checks: **0 errors** across all commits.

## Completed in Latest Session — Phase 2B-4: Admin EU Declaration Detail Overhaul (2026-05-08)

### Goal
Tighten the admin EU Entry Certificate detail page: surface all certificate fields, add Download Certificate and Acknowledge Declaration actions, and wire up admin-authenticated proxy routes for both.

### New: `app/api/admin/eu-declarations/[id]/download/route.ts`
GET proxy. Reads `admin_token` cookie, forwards to `GET /api/v1/admin/eu-declarations/{id}/download`. Preserves `Content-Type` + `Content-Disposition` headers for PDF stream.

### New: `app/api/admin/eu-declarations/[id]/acknowledge/route.ts`
PATCH proxy. Reads `admin_token` cookie, forwards to `PATCH /api/v1/admin/eu-declarations/{id}/acknowledge`. Returns Laravel response body + status unchanged.

### New: `components/admin/eu-declaration-actions.tsx`
`"use client"` component. Owns the status banner AND the action buttons so that the banner updates optimistically when the admin acknowledges (no page reload needed).

**Props:** `{ id, initialStatus, orderRef }`

**States managed:**
- `status` — drives the banner colour + badge + label, and which buttons are visible
- `downloading` / `acknowledging` — per-button spinners + disabled states
- `ackError` — inline error message below the buttons

**Download Certificate button:**
- Visible when `status === "signed"` or `"acknowledged"`
- Calls `/api/admin/eu-declarations/{id}/download`, streams `blob()` → `createObjectURL()` → programmatic `<a>` click
- Filename: `EU-Certificate-{orderRef}.pdf`

**Acknowledge Declaration button:**
- Visible only when `status === "signed"`
- Calls PATCH `/api/admin/eu-declarations/${id}/acknowledge`
- On success: optimistically sets `status = "acknowledged"` — banner flips to emerald, button disappears
- On error: shows backend `message` field below the buttons

### Updated: `app/admin/eu-declarations/[id]/page.tsx`

**`EuDeclarationFull` type expanded** with all certificate fields:
```typescript
delivery_address?, delivery_city?, delivery_postal_code?,  // order delivery snapshot
goods_description?,
month_year_received?, member_state_of_entry?, place_of_entry?,
self_transported?: boolean | null,
month_year_transport_ended?,
representative_name?, representative_title?,
signed_name?,
admin_acknowledged_at?,
```

**Removed:** static server-rendered status banner (replaced by `EuDeclarationActions` client component).

**Added:** Three-card layout:
1. **Order & Customer** — Order Ref (linked), Customer, Company, Email, Country, VAT Number, Street Address, City, Postal Code
2. **Certificate Details** — Goods Description (if present), Month/Year Received, EU Member State, Place of Entry, Own Transport (Yes/No badge), Transport Ended (if self-transported)
3. **Representative & Signature** — Representative Name, Title/Position, Signed Name (mono), Signed At, Admin Acknowledged At (if set), Declaration ID, Created, Last Updated

**`BoolBadge` helper** — renders boolean fields as emerald/grey pill badges.
**`InfoRow`** — gains `mono` and `span` props for VAT/signature values and full-width rows.

TypeScript check: **0 errors**.

---

### Backend changes required (Laravel — `api.okelcor.de`)

#### 1. `PATCH /api/v1/admin/eu-declarations/{id}/acknowledge`
Must be added. Suggested implementation:
```php
// AdminEuDeclarationController::acknowledge()
public function acknowledge($id)
{
    $declaration = EuDeclaration::findOrFail($id);
    $declaration->update([
        'status'                 => 'acknowledged',
        'admin_acknowledged_at'  => now(),
        'admin_acknowledged_by'  => auth()->id(),
    ]);
    return response()->json(['data' => $declaration, 'message' => 'Declaration acknowledged.']);
}
// Route:
Route::patch('eu-declarations/{id}/acknowledge', [AdminEuDeclarationController::class, 'acknowledge']);
```

#### 2. `GET /api/v1/admin/eu-declarations/{id}/download`
Must return the signed PDF. Suggested implementation:
```php
public function download($id)
{
    $declaration = EuDeclaration::findOrFail($id);
    return Storage::download(
        $declaration->signed_document_path,
        "EU-Certificate-{$declaration->order_ref}.pdf"
    );
}
```

#### 3. `GET /api/v1/admin/eu-declarations/{id}` — include all form fields
Response must include all fields submitted by the customer:
`month_year_received`, `member_state_of_entry`, `place_of_entry`, `self_transported`, `month_year_transport_ended`, `representative_name`, `representative_title`, `signed_name`, `admin_acknowledged_at`

#### 4. Address snapshot fix
When the customer POSTs `POST /api/v1/auth/orders/{ref}/declaration`, the backend must snapshot the delivery address from the order onto the `eu_declarations` record:
```php
$declaration->update([
    ...
    'delivery_address'      => $order->delivery_address,
    'delivery_city'         => $order->delivery_city,
    'delivery_postal_code'  => $order->delivery_postal_code,
    'country'               => $order->delivery_country ?? $order->country,
    'vat_number'            => $order->customer->vat_number,
    'goods_description'     => $order->items->map(fn($i) => "{$i->quantity}× {$i->product_name}")->implode(', '),
]);
```
This ensures the PDF and the admin view always reflect the actual delivery address, not the account billing address.

---

## Completed in Latest Session — Phase 2B-3: Customer EU Entry Certificate Form (2026-05-07)

**Goal:** Replace the read-only declaration notice in the customer order detail with a fully functional Gelangensbestätigung signing form so customers can complete the declaration directly from their account, without contacting Okelcor.

### New: `components/account/entry-certificate-card.tsx`

`"use client"` component with three display states driven by local React state — no page refresh after submit.

**Pending state** — full form:
- **Goods Receipt**: month + year dropdowns (MM/YYYY), EU member state select (all 27 states; pre-fills from `orderCountry` prop by matching code or full name), place of entry / customs office text input, own transport checkbox → conditional "month transport ended" month + year dropdowns
- **Authorised Representative**: full name (required), title / position (optional)
- **Signature**: printed name field (auto-uppercases every keystroke), canvas signature pad, §17a UStDV legal declaration checkbox

**Canvas signature pad:**
- Drawing buffer sized to `Math.round(rect.width × DPR)` × `Math.round(rect.height × DPR)` so CSS pixel coordinates from pointer events map correctly — fixes the root cause of invisible strokes (default 300×150 buffer vs. ~600px wide display)
- `ctx.scale(DPR, DPR)` keeps coordinate space in CSS pixels
- Quadratic Bézier curves via midpoint (`quadraticCurveTo(prevX, prevY, midX, midY)`) for smooth lines
- `pointerleave` handler stops drawing when pointer exits the canvas
- `clearSignature` clears using `ctx.clearRect(0, 0, rect.width, rect.height)` (CSS pixel coords, consistent with scaled context)
- Stroke: `#111827`, `lineWidth: 2.5`, `lineCap: "round"`, `lineJoin: "round"`
- Canvas CSS: `h-[200px] w-full cursor-crosshair bg-white`, `touch-action: none`

**Client-side validation**: all required fields, `signedName === signedName.toUpperCase()`, signature canvas must be drawn, terms must be accepted. Shows per-field inline errors.

**Submit**: `POST /api/account/orders/{ref}/declaration`. On success: optimistically sets `localStatus = "signed"` without page reload.

**API error display**: parses Laravel's `errors` object and renders every validation message as its own `<p>` — no `"(and N more errors)"` truncation.

**Download**: `fetch()` → `blob()` → `URL.createObjectURL()` → programmatic `<a>` click. Preserves `Content-Disposition` filename from backend.

**Signed state** — green card: submitted date, signed name, Download Certificate button.

**Acknowledged state** — green card: Okelcor confirmation message, Download Certificate button.

#### Payload sent to backend:
```json
{
  "month_year_received": "01/2026",
  "member_state_of_entry": "France",
  "place_of_entry": "Port of Rotterdam",
  "self_transported": false,
  "month_year_transport_ended": null,
  "representative_name": "John Oluwaseyi",
  "representative_title": "Order Manager",
  "signed_name": "JOHN OLUWASEYI",
  "signature_data": "data:image/png;base64,...",
  "accepted_terms": true
}
```

`member_state_of_entry` sends the full country **name** (e.g. `"France"`), not the ISO code (`"FR"`). The form stores the code for the select; the payload builder resolves the name via `EU_STATES.find(s => s.code === form.memberState)?.name`.

### New: `app/api/account/orders/[ref]/declaration/route.ts`
POST proxy. Reads `customer_token` cookie, forwards JSON body to `POST /api/v1/auth/orders/{ref}/declaration` with Bearer auth. Returns Laravel response body and status unchanged.

### New: `app/api/account/orders/[ref]/declaration/download/route.ts`
GET proxy. Reads `customer_token` cookie, forwards to `GET /api/v1/auth/orders/{ref}/declaration/download`. Streams binary response via `arrayBuffer()`; preserves `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` headers for PDF download.

### Updated: `app/account/orders/page.tsx`
Added two fields to the exported `Order` type:
```typescript
country?: string | null;
declaration_signed_name?: string | null;
```

### Updated: `app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx`
- Removed `FileCheck` from lucide-react imports
- Added `import EntryCertificateCard from "@/components/account/entry-certificate-card"`
- Replaced entire inline EU Entry Certificate amber/green div block with:
```tsx
<EntryCertificateCard
  orderRef={order.ref}
  orderCountry={order.country}
  status={order.declaration_status}
  signedAt={order.declaration_signed_at}
  signedName={order.declaration_signed_name}
/>
```

**Commits:** `c126a74` (Phase 2B-3 foundation) · `c12d7ec` (payload key fix) · `d28231f` (signature pad visibility + smoothness fix)

TypeScript check: **0 errors** across all three commits.

## Completed in Latest Session — Phase 2B-2: EU Entry Certificate Visibility (2026-05-07)

### Phase 2B-2 — EU Entry Certificate Visibility Foundation

**Goal:** Surface the Gelangensbestätigung (EU Entry Certificate, §17a UStDV) declaration status to both customers and admins, and provide a dedicated admin list + detail view.

**Background:** For intra-community B2B zero-VAT supplies (reverse charge), German law requires the supplier to hold a signed entry confirmation from the buyer. Backend now exposes declaration fields on orders.

#### Updated: `lib/admin-api.ts`
Added four optional fields to `AdminOrderFull`:
```typescript
declaration_required?: boolean | null;
declaration_status?: "pending" | "signed" | "acknowledged" | null;
declaration_id?: number | null;
declaration_signed_at?: string | null;
```

#### Updated: `app/account/orders/page.tsx`
Added three declaration fields to the exported `Order` type:
```typescript
declaration_required?: boolean | null;
declaration_status?: "pending" | "signed" | "acknowledged" | null;
declaration_signed_at?: string | null;
```

#### Updated: `app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx`
EU Entry Certificate card inserted between payment card and status timeline.

- Only rendered when `order.declaration_required === true`
- **Pending (amber):** "Action required: EU Entry Certificate (Gelangensbestätigung)" + explanation of §17a UStDV obligation
- **Signed (green):** "Signed — awaiting acknowledgement from Okelcor" + signed date if present
- **Acknowledged (green):** "Confirmed — Okelcor has acknowledged receipt of your signed declaration"
- Imports `FileCheck` from lucide-react

#### Updated: `components/admin/order-detail.tsx`
EU Entry Certificate card added after the two-column customer/order summary section, before Order Items.

- Visible when `order.declaration_required != null`
- Shows: Required (Yes/No), Status badge (amber/blue/emerald), Declaration ID (always shown; clickable link to `/admin/eu-declarations/{id}` or `—` when null), Signed At (always shown; `—` when null)

#### New: `app/admin/eu-declarations/page.tsx`
List page at `/admin/eu-declarations`. Fetches `GET /admin/eu-declarations`.

Columns: Order Ref (linked to order detail), Customer / Company, Email, Country, VAT Number, Status badge, Signed, Created, View button.

- `EuDeclaration` type defined locally with all fields including `email`
- Status badges: amber (pending), blue (signed), emerald (acknowledged)
- View button links to `/admin/eu-declarations/{id}`
- Handles `AdminUnauthorizedError` → redirect to `/admin/login`; `AdminForbiddenError` → redirect to `/admin/unauthorized`

#### New: `app/admin/eu-declarations/[id]/page.tsx`
Detail page at `/admin/eu-declarations/{id}`. Fetches `GET /admin/eu-declarations/{id}`.

- **Status banner** at top: colour-coded (amber/blue/green) with human-readable description
- **Order & Customer card**: Order Ref (linked), Customer, Company, Email, Country, VAT Number
- **Declaration Details card**: Created, Signed At, Updated; optional "Download / View Document" link when `signed_document_url` is present
- **Notes section** (conditional): Customer Notes + Internal Admin Notes (amber block)
- Handles 404 (`notFound()`), 401, 403 gracefully
- Back link to `/admin/eu-declarations`

#### Updated: `components/admin/admin-shell.tsx`
- Added `FileCheck` to lucide-react imports
- Added `{ label: "EU Declarations", href: "/admin/eu-declarations", icon: FileCheck, section: "eu_declarations" }` to `NAV` immediately after "Quote Requests"

#### Updated: `lib/admin-permissions.ts`
- Added `eu_declarations` to `super_admin`, `admin`, and `order_manager` access lists
- Added `"/admin/eu-declarations": "eu_declarations"` to `PATH_SECTION`
- `editor` role does **not** have access

---

## Completed in Latest Session — Phase 2A: EU VAT Enforcement & RFQ Form Upgrade (2026-05-07)

### Phase 2A-1 — Mandatory EU VAT Workflow for B2B Customers

**Goal:** EU business customers outside Germany must validate their VAT number before checkout or quote submission. Germany always shows an amber note that German VAT still applies.

**Rules implemented:**
| Customer type + country | VAT field | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| B2B + EU outside Germany | Shown, required | Submit blocked until valid |
| B2B + Germany | Shown, optional | Amber note always shown; submit never blocked |
| B2B + non-EU | Shown, optional | No VAT constraint |
| B2C (any country) | Hidden | No VAT field |

#### New: `lib/eu-vat.ts`
Single source of truth for the EU country set and the helper function. Both checkout and quote form import from here.
```typescript
export const EU_COUNTRIES = new Set([...27 member states...]);
export function isEuCountryExceptGermany(country: string): boolean { ... }
```

#### Updated: `components/vat-field.tsx`
Added `required?: boolean` prop. When `true`, label shows an orange `*`; when `false`, shows `(optional)` muted text.

#### Updated: `components/checkout/checkout-flow.tsx`
- Removed local `EU_COUNTRIES` duplicate; imports from `@/lib/eu-vat`
- Added `vatRequired` derived value: `showVatField && isEuCountryExceptGermany(delivery.country)`
- `getVatMessage`: Germany amber note shows unconditionally (not gated on `vatValid`)
- Submit guard: if `vatRequired && !vatValid` → scroll to VAT field, block submit
- `vatError` only displayed when `vatRequired` is still true (clears on country change)
- VAT field passes `required={vatRequired}` + helper text "Required for EU intra-community business purchases."

#### Updated: `components/quote/quote-form.tsx`
Same EU VAT logic applied. `vatRequired = showVatField && isEuCountryExceptGermany(form.country)`.

---

### Phase 2A-2 — RFQ Form Upgrade

**Goal:** Upgrade the quote request form so Okelcor receives enough information to quote without follow-up calls.

#### Updated: `components/quote/quote-form.tsx` (full rewrite)

New fields and features added:

**Tyre condition toggle:**
- "New tyres" / "Used tyres" pill toggle
- When Used: shows Grade dropdown (Grade A / Grade B / Mixed) + Used Tyre Notes textarea
- `tyreCondition`, `usedTyreGrade`, `usedTyreNotes` submitted to backend

**Dynamic tyre size rows:**
- Replaced single size + quantity fields with a multi-row list
- Add row / remove row (Trash2 icon) per entry
- Submits `tyre_items: Array<{ size, quantity }>` array
- Legacy compat: also sends `tyre_size` (first row size) and `quantity` (first row qty)
- Validation: at least one row must have a size before submit

**Company/contact fields (new):**
- Contact Person (who makes the purchasing decision)
- Company Address (street), City, Postal Code

**Logistics Terms (EU-aware):**
- If country is in EU: label "Delivery Terms", options: DAP / DDP / EXW, `incoterm_type: "delivery_terms"`
- If country is outside EU: label "Shipping Terms", options: FOB / CIF / EXW, `incoterm_type: "shipping_terms"`
- Incoterm resets when customer switches between EU ↔ non-EU countries
- Submitted as `incoterm` + `incoterm_type`

**Submit paths:** Both JSON and FormData (multipart) paths include all new fields.

**Types added to `FormData`:**
`contactPerson`, `companyAddress`, `companyCity`, `companyPostalCode`, `tyreCondition`, `usedTyreGrade`, `usedTyreNotes`, `incoterm`

**Removed:** `tyreSize`, `quantity` (replaced by `tyreItems` array; legacy fallback fields still sent)

#### Updated: `lib/admin-api.ts`
14 new optional fields added to `AdminQuoteFull`:
```typescript
vat_number?, business_type?, contact_person?,
company_address?, company_city?, company_postal_code?,
tyre_condition?, used_tyre_grade?, used_tyre_notes?,
tyre_items?: Array<{ size: string; quantity: string }> | null,
delivery_timeline?, budget_range?, incoterm?, incoterm_type?
```

#### Updated: `components/admin/quote-detail.tsx`
All new Phase 2A-2 fields are now displayed:

**Requester Details card** — added:
- Contact Person, Business Type, VAT Number
- Company Address (combined street + city + postal)

**Request Details card** — added:
- Tyre Condition, Budget Range, Delivery Timeline
- Incoterm with contextual label ("Delivery Terms" / "Shipping Terms" / "Incoterm")

**New "Tyre Sizes & Quantities" card:**
- Table showing each row: #, Tyre Size, Quantity
- Only rendered when `tyre_items` has entries

**New "Used Tyre Details" card (conditional):**
- Only rendered when `tyre_condition === "Used tyres"` and grade or notes are present
- Shows Grade + multi-line Notes

TypeScript check: **0 errors** after all changes.

---

### Phase 2A-3 — Convert Quote Modal Prefill from `tyre_items`

**Goal:** Use the structured `tyre_items` array submitted with the Phase 2A-2 RFQ form to pre-populate item rows in the Convert to Order modal, reducing manual data entry for the admin.

#### Updated: `components/admin/quote-convert-modal.tsx`

- **Replaced** `buildInitialItem(quote): ItemRow` (single row) with `buildInitialItems(quote): ItemRow[]` (multiple rows)
- **Tyre items path** (when `quote.tyre_items` is a non-empty array):
  - One `ItemRow` per `tyre_items` entry
  - `name` = `"{brand || 'Quoted tyre'} {size}"` (trimmed)
  - `brand` = `quote.brand_preference ?? ""`
  - `size` = `item.size?.trim() ?? ""`
  - `quantity` = parsed integer from `item.quantity`; empty string if NaN or ≤ 0
  - `sku`, `unit_price` = `""` (admin fills in)
- **Legacy fallback** (when no `tyre_items`): single row from `quote.tyre_size` + `quote.quantity` (previous behaviour)
- `useState<ItemRow[]>` uses a lazy initializer `() => buildInitialItems(quote)` to avoid re-running on every render
- **Size validation**: per-row guard `if (!item.size.trim()) return 'Item N: tyre size is required.'`
- **Quantity check** updated: `!Number.isInteger(qty) || qty < 1`
- **Helper text banner** (blue): *"Rows are prefilled from the customer's RFQ. Please confirm product names, quantities and prices before creating the order."*

---

## Completed in Previous Session — Shipment Events, Carrier Type & Order Status (2026-05-06)

### Backend: Revert Shipment Event Field to `event_date` (2026-05-06)

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminOrderShipmentEventController.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminOrderController.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php`

**Problem:** Backend commit `3e7e682` renamed the response field from `event_date` to `date` to fix the crash. The frontend team independently fixed the crash (commit `ed6ab25`) by updating their types to use `event_date` instead. The two fixes went in opposite directions — backend returned `date`, frontend read `event_date` → all event dates displayed as "—".

**Fix:** Backend reverted all three formatters back to returning `event_date` to match the frontend contract. Commit `50ffd1c`.

**Authoritative contract:** All three API endpoints return `event_date` (not `date`) on every `ShipmentEvent` object:
- `POST /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/shipment-events` → `{ data: { id, event_date, ... } }`
- `GET /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}` → `data.shipment_events[].event_date`
- `GET /api/v1/orders/{ref}` → `data.shipment_events[].event_date`

---

### Crash with 2+ Shipment Events — Fixed

**Root cause:** Frontend type had `date: string` but backend always returned `event_date`. With 0–1 events `.sort()` never calls the comparator — bug invisible. With 2+ events, `a.date.localeCompare(b.date)` fires on `undefined` → `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'localeCompare')`, crashing admin detail, customer detail, and customer tracking pages.

**Frontend fix (commit `ed6ab25`):**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `lib/admin-api.ts` | `ShipmentEvent.date: string` → `event_date?: string \| null` |
| `app/admin/orders/actions.ts` | `ShipmentEventRow.date` → `event_date?: string \| null` |
| `components/admin/order-detail.tsx` | Sort comparator, optimistic constructors, `startEdit` prefill, date display — all `ev.date` → `ev.event_date ?? ""` |
| `components/account/shipment-tracker.tsx` | Local type + sort comparator + date display updated to `ev.event_date ?? undefined` |

TypeScript check passes with zero errors.

---

### Backend: `carrier_type` Not Persisting on Order Save — Fixed

**Files:** `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminOrderController.php`

**Root cause:** `carrier_type` was validated in both `update()` and `updateStatus()` but omitted from `$request->only([...])` in both methods, so it was silently dropped. Also missing from `formatOrderDetail()` and the PATCH response body, causing the admin panel to revert the select to its old value after every save.

**Fix (commit `0e8cdfa`):**
- Added `'carrier_type'` to `$request->only()` in both `update()` and `updateStatus()`
- Added `'carrier_type' => $o->carrier_type` to `formatOrderDetail()`
- Added `'carrier_type' => $order->carrier_type` to the `updateStatus()` PATCH response body
- Added `'carrier_type' => $o->carrier_type` to `OrderController::formatOrder()` (customer endpoint)

---

### Customer Order Status Timeline — `confirmed` Status Missing — Fixed

**Root cause:** Backend correctly returns `status: "confirmed"` for admin-confirmed orders. Frontend `OrderStatus` type and `STEP_ORDER` map did not include `"confirmed"`, so the timeline step lookup returned `undefined` and "Order Placed" stayed highlighted regardless of actual status.

**Frontend fix (commit `fcad9c3`):**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `app/account/orders/page.tsx` | Added `"confirmed"` to `OrderStatus` union type; added `confirmed: 1` to `STEP_ORDER` map |
| `app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx` | Updated `TIMELINE_STEPS` to include a "Confirmed" step; `processing` maps to same step index as `confirmed` |

**Final status → step mapping:**
| `order.status` | Step |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Order Placed |
| `confirmed` | Confirmed |
| `processing` | Confirmed (same step) |
| `shipped` | Shipped |
| `delivered` | Delivered |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled state |

No backend changes needed — backend was already returning the correct value.

---

### Backend: Manual Bus/Road Freight Shipment Event Tracking — Added

**Commits:** `b89dd2e` (backend)

New table `order_shipment_events` and admin CRUD endpoints to manually track bus/road freight shipments that have no external tracking API.

**New backend:**
- Migration: `order_shipment_events` table (id, order_id, order_ref, event_date, location, status_label, description, admin_user_id, timestamps)
- Migration: adds `bus` to `orders.carrier_type` enum (was: sea/air/dhl/road)
- Model: `OrderShipmentEvent` with date cast and `belongsTo(Order)`
- `Order` model: `shipmentEvents()` hasMany, ordered by event_date + created_at asc
- Controller: `AdminOrderShipmentEventController` — store / update / destroy; `syncTrackingStatus()` keeps `orders.tracking_status` in sync with latest event label
- Routes: `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/admin/orders/{id}/shipment-events/{event?}`

**Customer endpoints updated:** Both `GET /api/v1/orders/{ref}` and `GET /api/v1/orders?email=` now eager-load and return `shipment_events` array.

⚠️ **Namecheap deploy required:** Run `php artisan migrate --force` — two new migrations.

## Completed in Previous Session — Order Payment UX & Checkout VAT Preview (2026-05-04)

### Customer Order Detail — Dynamic Payment Section

**Files:** `app/api/account/orders/[ref]/checkout/route.ts` (new), `components/account/order-payment-card.tsx` (new), `app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx`

Replaced the static `payment_url` link and hardcoded "Payment link sent by email" fallback with a fully dynamic client component backed by a new proxy route.

#### Proxy route (`app/api/account/orders/[ref]/checkout/route.ts`)
- `POST /api/account/orders/{ref}/checkout` reads `customer_token` cookie, forwards to `POST /api/v1/auth/orders/{ref}/checkout` with Bearer auth
- Returns `{ data: { checkout_url, checkout_session_id, order_ref } }` from Laravel unchanged

#### `OrderPaymentCard` client component (`components/account/order-payment-card.tsx`)
Renders based on `payment_status` + `payment_method`:

| State | UI |
|---|---|
| `paid` | Green "Payment Complete" block |
| `pending` + `stripe` | "Payment Required" + **"Pay securely with Stripe"** button → calls proxy → stores `stripe_order_ref` in sessionStorage → `window.location.href = checkout_url` |
| `pending` + `bank_transfer` | "Payment by Bank Transfer — Our team will share payment instructions." |
| `pending` + other/unknown | Amber clock — "Awaiting payment instructions from Okelcor." |
| `payment_status` absent | Card not rendered |

Inline errors: 401 → session expired; 409 → not awaiting payment; 422 → not Stripe order; network → retry prompt.

#### Order detail page (`app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx`)
- Removed: IIFE payment block, `CreditCard`, `Mail`, `ExternalLink` imports
- Added: `<OrderPaymentCard orderRef={order.ref} paymentMethod={...} paymentStatus={...} />` rendered when `order.payment_status` is defined

---

### Checkout Order Summary — Tax Label Fix

**Files:** `lib/translations.ts`, `components/checkout/order-summary.tsx`

Removed the misleading "Tax calculated on invoice" copy (incorrect since Stripe now calculates VAT before charge). Updated all 4 locales (EN/DE/FR/ES):

| Key | Before | After (EN) |
|---|---|---|
| `subtotal` | "Subtotal" | "Subtotal (net)" |
| `tax` | "Tax" | "VAT" |
| `taxNote` | "Calculated on invoice" | "VAT calculated securely before payment" |
| `taxDisclaimer` | "Excl. applicable taxes · Final amount confirmed on order" | "Final gross amount — confirmed at Stripe Checkout" |

Tax row in `order-summary.tsx` changed from `SummaryRow` (right-aligned, unsuited for text values) to a two-line stacked muted block.

---

### Checkout — Live VAT Preview from Backend

**Files:** `app/api/checkout/tax-preview/route.ts` (new), `components/checkout/order-summary.tsx`, `components/checkout/checkout-flow.tsx`, `components/vat-field.tsx`

#### Proxy route (`app/api/checkout/tax-preview/route.ts`)
- `POST /api/checkout/tax-preview` forwards to `POST /api/v1/payments/tax-preview`; attaches `customer_token` Bearer if present

#### Backend response shape
```json
{
  "data": {
    "subtotal_net": 29.40,
    "delivery_cost": 0.00,
    "tax_rate": 19.00,
    "tax_amount": 5.59,
    "tax_treatment": "standard",
    "is_reverse_charge": false,
    "total": 34.99,
    "note": null
  }
}
```

#### `VatField` (`components/vat-field.tsx`)
Added `onValidationChange?: (valid: boolean) => void` prop:
- Fires `true` when VIES validation returns valid
- Fires `false` on invalid, unavailable, and whenever the user edits the field (resetting validity)

#### `CheckoutFlow` (`components/checkout/checkout-flow.tsx`)
- Added `vatValid: boolean` state (initially `false`), driven by `VatField.onValidationChange`
- Passes 4 new props to `OrderSummary`: `country`, `vatNumber`, `vatValid`, `customerType`

#### `OrderSummary` (`components/checkout/order-summary.tsx`)
Full rewrite of the totals section:
- `vatNumber` tracked via `useRef` (synced every render) — not a `useEffect` dependency, so keystrokes do not trigger API calls
- `useEffect` triggers on: `items`, `deliveryCost`, `fetAddon`, `country`, `vatValid`, `customerType`
- 400ms debounce + `AbortController` cancel on dep change

**VAT row display:**

| Preview state | Display |
|---|---|
| `taxLoading` | `Loader2` spinner + "Calculating VAT…"; Total shows `—` |
| `tax_treatment === "standard"` | `VAT (19%): €5.59`; Total = `taxPreview.total` (gross) |
| `is_reverse_charge === true` | `VAT reverse charge (0%): €0.00` + optional `note` |
| `tax_treatment === "exempt"` | `VAT exempt (0%): €0.00` + optional `note` |
| Error / no country | Italic fallback "VAT will be confirmed at Stripe Checkout." + `taxDisclaimer` |

When preview is active: subtotal and total rows use backend values (`subtotal_net`, `total`). Disclaimer row hidden.

---

## Completed in Previous Session — Quote Email Handoff & Crisp Tier Regression (2026-05-04)

### Quote Requests Proxy — Resend Block Removed

**File:** `app/api/customer/quote-requests/route.ts`

Backend now sends **both** the admin notification email and the customer auto-reply on every successful `POST /api/v1/quote-requests`. The frontend Resend call was removed to prevent duplicate emails.

**What was removed:** `Resend` import + instance, `FROM_EMAIL`, `esc()`/`row()`/`section()`/`buildNotificationHtml()` helpers, `getSiteSettings()` call, entire Resend send block.

**What remains:** Clean proxy — receives POST (JSON or multipart), forwards to `POST /api/v1/quote-requests`, returns Laravel response unchanged.

---

### Crisp Live Chat — Tier Regression Investigation

**File:** `app/api/admin/crisp/route.ts`

**Root cause:** A prior commit changed `X-Crisp-Tier` from `"website"` to `"plugin"`. When merged to main this caused the Crisp conversations endpoint to return 404.

**Current state:**
- **main** — `X-Crisp-Tier: "website"`, env var reading: `CRISP_API_IDENTIFIER ?? CRISP_IDENTIFIER` + `CRISP_API_KEY ?? CRISP_KEY` → **working**
- **dev** — `X-Crisp-Tier: "plugin"`, env vars: `CRISP_IDENTIFIER` + `CRISP_KEY` only → **not pushed to main**

**Credentials (confirmed):**
```
CRISP_IDENTIFIER=bee0fee1-b3b0-416b-ad23-403a1c764114
CRISP_KEY=1ee43f026109e1a745a13e68525a005d59cb660cc066b55d661c619389e06da6
NEXT_PUBLIC_CRISP_WEBSITE_ID=137b074d-e431-4e79-8c69-8484dcf89fbf
```
Authorization: `Basic BASE64(CRISP_IDENTIFIER:CRISP_KEY)`

**⚠️ Unresolved:** User states the correct tier is `"plugin"` but using it on main caused 404. Must test both tiers in isolation on the live Crisp account. Do NOT merge dev version to main until confirmed.

---

## Completed in Previous Session — Pay Now CTA for Pending Stripe Orders (2026-05-04)

### Account Orders — Pay Now Button

**Files:** `app/account/orders/page.tsx`, `app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx`

Added a Pay Now CTA for orders where `payment_method === "stripe"` AND `payment_status === "pending"`.

#### Order list (`app/account/orders/page.tsx`)
- `Order` type gains: `payment_method?: string`, `payment_status?: string`, `payment_url?: string | null`, `checkout_url?: string | null`
- Amber **"Payment due"** badge shown in the status column alongside the order status
- CTA column: when payment is pending + URL available → orange **"Pay Now"** external link; when no URL → standard **"Track Order"** button; applies to both desktop table and mobile card layout

#### Order detail (`app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx`)
Payment card inserted between order header and status timeline:
- `payment_method === "stripe"` AND `payment_status === "pending"` → card renders
- If `payment_url ?? checkout_url` is present: orange **"Pay securely with Stripe"** button (external link, `target="_blank"`)
- If no URL: amber notice — *"Payment link sent by email — check your inbox"*

---

## Completed in Previous Session — Quote Form Delivery Address Fields (2026-05-04)

### Customer Quote Form — Structured Delivery Address

**Files:** `components/quote/quote-form.tsx`, `app/api/customer/quote-requests/route.ts`, `lib/translations.ts`, `lib/admin-api.ts`, `components/admin/quote-detail.tsx`, `components/admin/quote-convert-modal.tsx`

Added 3 structured address fields to the customer quote form, submitted to the backend, shown in admin, and used to prefill the Convert to Order modal.

#### Quote form (`components/quote/quote-form.tsx`)
- `FormData` gains `deliveryAddress`, `deliveryCity`, `deliveryPostalCode`
- New **"Delivery Details"** section (`sectionDelivery`) added between the timeline/budget fields and notes:
  - **Street / Delivery Address** — full-width, optional
  - **City** — half-width, optional
  - **Postal Code** — half-width, optional
  - **Preferred delivery location / port** — full-width, required (renamed from "Preferred Delivery Location"; placeholder now `"e.g. Hamburg Port, Lagos, Dubai"`)
- Both multipart (`FormData`) and JSON submit paths include `delivery_address`, `delivery_city`, `delivery_postal_code`
- `handleReset` clears the 3 new fields

#### Email notification (`app/api/customer/quote-requests/route.ts`)
- Logistics section email rows now include: Delivery Address, City, Postal Code, Delivery Location / Port (rows are empty/hidden automatically when not provided via the `row()` helper)

#### Admin types (`lib/admin-api.ts`)
- `AdminQuoteFull` gains `delivery_address?: string`, `delivery_city?: string`, `delivery_postal_code?: string`

#### Admin quote detail (`components/admin/quote-detail.tsx`)
- Request Details card now shows Delivery Address, City, Postal Code, Location / Port rows (only visible when populated)

#### Convert to Order modal (`components/admin/quote-convert-modal.tsx`)
- Delivery form prefills from quote:
  - `address` ← `quote.delivery_address ?? ""`
  - `city` ← `quote.delivery_city ?? ""`
  - `postal_code` ← `quote.delivery_postal_code ?? ""`
  - `country` ← `quote.country ?? ""` (unchanged)
  - `phone` ← `quote.phone ?? ""` (unchanged)
- Admin can edit all fields in the modal before converting

#### Translations (`lib/translations.ts`)
- Type definition gains: `sectionDelivery`, `labelDeliveryAddress`, `labelDeliveryCity`, `labelDeliveryPostalCode`, `placeholderDeliveryAddress`, `placeholderDeliveryCity`, `placeholderDeliveryPostalCode`
- All 4 locales (EN/DE/FR/ES) updated with the new keys; `labelDelivery` and `placeholderDelivery` updated to reflect the renamed field

## Completed in Previous Session — Admin Quote → Order Conversion UI (2026-05-04)

### Admin Quote Detail — Convert to Order

**Files:** `lib/admin-api.ts`, `app/admin/quotes/actions.ts`, `components/admin/quote-convert-modal.tsx` (new), `components/admin/quote-detail.tsx`

Implemented the full Quote → Order conversion flow in the admin panel.

#### Type changes (`lib/admin-api.ts`)
- `AdminQuote` (list type) gains `order_id?: number | null`, `order_ref?: string | null`
- `AdminQuoteFull` (detail type) gains `brand_preference?: string`, `tyre_size?: string`, `admin_notes?: string`

#### Server action (`app/admin/quotes/actions.ts`)
Added `convertQuoteToOrder(id, payload)`:
- `POST /api/v1/admin/quote-requests/{id}/convert-to-order`
- Explicit 422 handling: "Quote must be in Quoted status" message
- Explicit 409 handling: "Already converted" message
- Returns `{ data: ConvertToOrderResult }` on success — `order_ref`, `order_id` (reads `data.order_id ?? data.id`), `quote_ref`, `status`, `payment_status`, `total`
- Revalidates `/admin/quotes` and `/admin/quotes/{id}` on success
- Exported types: `ConvertOrderItem`, `ConvertToOrderPayload`, `ConvertToOrderResult`

#### Conversion modal (`components/admin/quote-convert-modal.tsx`)
New `"use client"` component with:
- **Delivery section**: address (required), city (required), postal_code (required), country (defaults to `quote.country`), phone (defaults to `quote.phone`)
- **Items section**: pre-fills one item from `quote.brand_preference` + `quote.tyre_size`; inline per-row subtotal; Add Item / Remove Item (× button) with Trash2 icon; each row: name, brand, size, sku, unit_price, quantity
- **Order Summary**: live-computed subtotal, editable delivery cost field, total
- **Payment method**: select — Bank Transfer (default), Card (Stripe), Cash
- **Admin Notes**: optional textarea
- Client-side validation before submit (required fields, price/qty > 0)
- Error display from server action (422 / 409 / network)
- Spinner + "Converting…" text while pending
- `onSuccess(result)` callback called on success; `onClose()` on cancel/overlay click

#### Quote detail integration (`components/admin/quote-detail.tsx`)
New "Order Conversion" card added below the Status card:
- **status !== "quoted"**: shows explanatory text — "set status to Quoted to enable conversion"
- **status === "quoted" and not yet converted**: shows "Convert to Order" button (ShoppingCart icon) → opens modal
- **Converted** (either `quote.order_id` from initial load or `convertedOrder` state from this session): shows green success badge "Converted to order: OKL-..."
  - "View Order" link → `/admin/orders/{order_id}` when ID is available; falls back to `/admin/orders?q={order_ref}` when only ref is known
- `convertedOrder` state set from modal `onSuccess` without requiring a page reload
- Request Details card now also shows `brand_preference` and `tyre_size` rows (these were missing before)

## Completed in Previous Session — Invoice Proxy, Quote UX, File Upload & Dashboard (2026-05-04)

### Invoice PDF Download — Auth Proxy

**Files:** `app/api/account/invoices/[id]/download/route.ts` (created), `app/account/invoices/page.tsx`

Direct links to `inv.pdf_url` returned 401 because the browser cannot attach the httpOnly `customer_token` cookie as a Bearer header. A Next.js proxy route was created to bridge the gap:

- Reads `customer_token` from cookies server-side
- Forwards `GET /api/v1/invoices/{id}/download` with `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Preserves `Content-Type` + `Content-Disposition` response headers
- Returns binary body via `arrayBuffer()` (not `.json()`)
- Returns 401 if cookie absent, 404/500 with JSON error if Laravel fails

`app/account/invoices/page.tsx` download link `href` changed from `inv.pdf_url` to `/api/account/invoices/${inv.id}/download`. `inv.pdf_url` is still used as a boolean gate (shows "PDF pending" pill when absent).

**Temporary debug logs** in the download route (token present, target URL, Laravel status, error body). Remove once confirmed working in production.

---

### Customer Quote Request Tracking — Full UX Overhaul

**File:** `app/account/quotes/page.tsx`

Complete rewrite of the quotes page. Key additions:

- **`NormalizedStatus`** union: `"received" | "reviewed" | "quoted" | "closed"`
- **`normalizeStatus()`** maps backend variants: `new/pending → received`, `reviewing/reviewed → reviewed`, `quoted/approved → quoted`, `closed/rejected → closed`
- **`ProgressTracker`** component: 4 orange dots connected by lines; future steps dimmed; labels below each step
- **Note blocklist + `isMeaningfulNote()`** filters out test/placeholder notes (`"test"`, `"n/a"`, `"."`, etc.)
- **`admin_notes?: string`** field on `QuoteRequest` for future Okelcor team responses
- **Quoted CTA block**: green callout + orange pill button → `/contact?quote_ref=...` shown only when `normalized === "quoted"`
- **"Your message" label** on customer notes section; separate orange-tinted `admin_notes` block labelled "Okelcor response"
- **Dynamic account type label**: `isB2B ? "B2B" : "Personal"` (removed hardcoded "B2B")

`app/account/page.tsx`: Added "Quote Requests" `DashCard` to B2C dashboard (previously only in B2B).

---

### Quote Form — File Attachment Upload

**Files:** `components/quote/quote-form.tsx`, `app/api/customer/quote-requests/route.ts`

`components/quote/quote-form.tsx`:
- Accepted formats: `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.xls`, `.xlsx` (max 10 MB)
- `attachedFile: File | null` state; hidden `<input type="file">` via `useRef`
- UI: click-to-browse area when no file; filename + size + × remove button when file attached; inline validation errors for type/size
- `handleSubmit()`: if `attachedFile` → builds `FormData` with all text fields + `attachment` file, posts without `Content-Type` (browser sets boundary); else → existing JSON path
- `handleReset()` clears file state + resets native input element

`app/api/customer/quote-requests/route.ts`:
- Detects `multipart/form-data` via `content-type` request header
- Multipart path: `request.formData()` → extracts all text fields + `attachment_name` for email; forwards `FormData` directly to Laravel (no manual `Content-Type`)
- Email template includes `Attachment` row when `attachment_name` is present
- JSON path unchanged

---

### Admin Quote Detail — Attachment Display Fix

**Files:** `lib/admin-api.ts`, `components/admin/quote-detail.tsx`, `app/admin/quotes/[id]/page.tsx`

**Problem:** Backend sends `attachment_path` + `attachment_original_name` but the type only had `attachment_url` + `attachment_name`, so the attachment card never rendered.

**Fix:**
- `AdminQuoteFull` in `lib/admin-api.ts` now has all 6 variants: `attachment_url`, `attachment_path`, `attachment_name`, `attachment_original_name`, `attachment_mime`, `attachment_size`
- `components/admin/quote-detail.tsx`: IIFE resolves `attachmentUrl = quote.attachment_url ?? quote.attachment_path ?? null` and `attachmentName = quote.attachment_original_name ?? quote.attachment_name ?? null`; render guard is `!!(attachmentUrl || attachmentName)`
- Attachment card placed **above** the Notes section
- Shows `formatBytes(size) · mime` subtitle; orange Download button (opens in new tab) when URL available; "Download unavailable" text otherwise
- `formatBytes()` helper: B / KB / MB

**Temporary debug log** in `app/admin/quotes/[id]/page.tsx` logs all 6 attachment field values to server console. Remove once confirmed.

---

### Admin Dashboard — Connected to Real Laravel Endpoint

**File:** `app/api/admin/dashboard/stats/route.ts`

Previously all KPI cards showed computed fallback values. The route now calls `GET /api/v1/admin/dashboard` in the same `Promise.all` as orders/quotes/products.

- Response handling: `db = dashboardRes?.data ?? dashboardRes ?? {}` (handles both wrapped and flat responses)
- 9 fields extracted from `db` with `null` fallbacks: `revenue_today`, `orders_today_paid`, `new_customers_today`, `conversion_rate`, `average_order_value`, `aov_period_label`, `aov_paid_orders_count`, `aov_stripe_orders_count`, `aov_manual_orders_count`
- Chart: prefers `revenue_last_7_days` array from API; handles `revenue`/`confirmed`/`amount` keys; parses ISO dates with `new Date(y, m-1, d)` constructor (avoids UTC→local shift); falls back to computed from orders
- Return object: API values take precedence, computed values are fallback
- `aovPeriodLabel`, `aovPaidOrdersCount`, `aovStripeOrdersCount`, `aovManualOrdersCount` exposed in response

`components/admin/dashboard/revenue-chart.tsx`: Added 30s `setInterval` auto-refresh (previously fired only once on mount).

---

### Admin Dashboard — AOV Card Backend Labels

**File:** `components/admin/dashboard/hero-metrics.tsx`

- `Metrics` type gains 3 new nullable fields: `aovPeriodLabel: string | null`, `aovPaidOrdersCount: number | null`, `aovManualOrdersCount: number | null`
- `refresh()` reads these from `statsRes`
- `MetricCard` component gains optional `note?: string` prop — renders as small italic light-grey text below `sub`
- AOV card `sub` prop: `"{aovPeriodLabel} · {N} paid orders"` from backend; falls back to `"confirmed orders only"` when fields are null
- AOV card `note` prop: `"includes manual/imported orders"` shown only when `aovManualOrdersCount > 0`

---

## Completed in Previous Session — Admin Order Actions, Activity Log & Invoice UX (2026-05-03)

### Admin Order Detail — Cancel & Delete Actions

**Files:** `app/admin/orders/actions.ts`, `app/admin/orders/[id]/page.tsx`, `components/admin/order-detail.tsx`

Two new server actions added to `app/admin/orders/actions.ts`:

- **`cancelOrder(id)`** — `PATCH /admin/orders/{id}/status` with `{ status: "cancelled" }`. Revalidates both list and detail paths.
- **`deleteOrder(id, confirmRef)`** — `DELETE /admin/orders/{id}` with `{ confirm_ref }`. Explicit handling: 422 → ref mismatch message, 409 → paid order cannot be deleted message. Returns `{ deleted: true }` on success.

`app/admin/orders/[id]/page.tsx` updated to read `admin_role` cookie server-side and pass it as `adminRole` prop to `OrderDetail`.

`components/admin/order-detail.tsx` updated:
- **Cancel Order button**: visible to `admin`, `order_manager`, `super_admin`; disabled when status is `cancelled` or `delivered`; on success updates local status state to `cancelled` so button self-disables
- **Delete Order button**: always rendered; disabled (with tooltip) unless `super_admin`
- **Delete confirmation modal**: input must exactly match `order.order_ref` before confirm enables; inline error display for 422/409; on success navigates to `/admin/orders`
- New state: `cancelError`, `cancelSuccess`, `isCancelPending`, `deleteModalOpen`, `deleteRef`, `deleteError`, `isDeletePending`

---

### Admin Order Detail — Activity Log

**Files:** `lib/admin-api.ts`, `components/admin/order-detail.tsx`

New type added to `lib/admin-api.ts`:
```typescript
export type AdminOrderLog = {
  id: number;
  action: string;
  old_value?: string | null;
  new_value?: string | null;
  notes?: string | null;
  admin_user_email?: string | null;
  ip_address?: string | null;
  created_at: string;
};
```
`logs?: AdminOrderLog[]` added to `AdminOrderFull`.

New `ActivityLog` + `LogEntry` components added to `order-detail.tsx`:
- Timeline with orange dot markers consistent with the container tracking widget
- `formatAction()` converts snake_case action strings to Title Case
- Old value shown as red strikethrough badge, new value as green badge
- Admin email, IP address (monospace), notes, and timestamp per entry
- Empty state: "No activity has been recorded for this order yet."
- Card placed below Order Actions, above the delete modal

---

### Invoice Discovery & UX — B2B and B2C

**Files:** `app/account/page.tsx`, `app/account/invoices/page.tsx`

`app/account/page.tsx`:
- **B2C dashboard**: added "Receipts & Invoices" card (icon: `Receipt`, links to `/account/invoices`, description: "View receipts for your purchases") — previously invoices were only visible to B2B
- **B2B dashboard**: updated Invoices card description to "View paid invoices and billing records for your company."

`app/account/invoices/page.tsx`:
- Reads `customer.customer_type` to determine `isB2B`
- Fixed hardcoded `"B2B"` account badge — now shows `"Personal"` for B2C customers
- Page title: B2B → "Invoices", B2C → "Receipts & Invoices"
- Breadcrumb label updated to match page title
- Empty state: B2B → "No invoices yet. Paid orders will appear here after checkout." / B2C → "No receipts yet. Your paid orders will appear here."
- When `pdf_url` is absent: shows `"PDF pending"` pill badge instead of nothing

---

### Stripe Order Reference Audit (no code changes)

**Root cause identified:** Laravel's `POST /payments/create-session` does not return `order_ref` in its response. The order is created by the webhook (`checkout.session.completed`), not at session creation time. Frontend code is correct on both channels (URL param + sessionStorage fallback), but both are empty because the backend never supplies the value.

**Backend fix required:** Create the order record at session creation time, generate `order_ref`, return it in the response body (`data.order_ref`) AND embed it in the Stripe `success_url`:
```
{FRONTEND_URL}/checkout/return?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}&order_ref=OKL-XXXXX
```
Frontend requires no changes once the backend supplies the field.

---

## Completed in Previous Session — Admin RBAC, Product Card & Bug Fixes (2026-04-19/20)

### Product Card — Full-Bleed Image

**File:** `components/shop/product-card.tsx`

The product card was redesigned so the tyre image fills the entire card instead of being confined to a top `aspect-[4/3]` section.

**Changes:**
- Image is now `position: fill` covering the full card (no separate image container)
- `object-contain` keeps the full tyre visible with no cropping
- Card has `min-h-[360px]` so the `fill` image has a concrete height reference
- Info panel (brand, name, size, price, buttons) is pinned to the bottom with a **frosted-glass** treatment (`backdrop-blur-md` + `bg-white/88`) so text stays readable over any image
- Hover zoom reduced to `scale-[1.05]` (was 1.08/1.1) since the image is now larger
- Type badge and glare overlay kept, moved to correct `z-index` layers above the image

---

### Admin Panel — Auth UX & `must_change_password` Flow

#### New: `/admin/change-password` page
**File:** `app/admin/change-password/page.tsx`

- Standalone page within AdminShell for forced password changes
- Amber warning banner: "Your account is using a temporary password"
- Current password, new password (with 4-level strength bar), confirm fields
- Calls existing `changePassword` server action (`PUT /api/v1/admin/profile/password`)
- On success: clears `admin_must_change` cookie, redirects to `/admin`

#### Updated: `app/admin/actions.ts`
- **Key fix:** Was reading `json.data?.admin` from login response — backend confirmed the correct key is `json.data?.user`. This caused all admin cookies (role, display name, must_change_password) to be `undefined` on every login, silently breaking RBAC.
- Now reads `json.data?.user` correctly
- Stores `admin_must_change` cookie (`"1"` or `"0"`) on login based on `must_change_password` flag
- Stores `admin_role_label` cookie (human-readable label from API, e.g. `"Super Admin"`)
- Stores `admin_display_name` cookie (prefers `display_name` → `first_name` → `name`)
- If `must_change_password === true` → redirects to `/admin/change-password` instead of dashboard
- `logoutAdmin` now also deletes `admin_role_label` and `admin_must_change` cookies

#### Updated: `app/admin/profile/actions.ts`
- `updateProfile` now accepts `{ first_name, last_name, display_name, name }` instead of `(name, email)` — email is read-only
- On success: refreshes `admin_display_name` and `admin_name` cookies
- `changePassword`: on success reads `res.data?.user?.must_change_password` from response and sets `admin_must_change=0` cookie to dismiss the persistent banner

#### Updated: `components/admin/admin-shell.tsx`
- **Top-bar dropdown** on avatar button: My Profile → `/admin/profile`, Change Password → `/admin/change-password`, Sign Out (form action `logoutAdmin`)
- **`must_change_password` banner**: persistent amber bar shown on all pages (except `/admin/change-password`) when `admin_must_change=1` cookie is set — "Your account is using a temporary password. [Change password →]"
- **Role badge colors**: `super_admin` = dark (`bg-gray-900 text-white`), `admin` = blue, `editor` = green, `order_manager` = amber
- **Display name**: reads `admin_display_name` cookie for name display; falls back to `admin_name`
- **Role label**: reads `admin_role_label` cookie (set from API `role_label` field) instead of a client-side map

#### Updated: `components/admin/profile-ui.tsx`
- Edit form now has: **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Display Name** fields (split from single `name`)
- Email shown as read-only in edit mode
- Role badge uses `profile.role_label ?? ROLE_LABELS[profile.role]` (API label preferred)
- Cancel resets all three name fields to original profile values

#### Updated: `components/admin/users-manager.tsx`
- **Password field removed from create modal** — backend auto-generates and emails a temporary password
- Create modal shows blue info notice: "A temporary password will be sent to the user's email address."
- After successful user creation: shows green banner "User created. Login details sent to {email}" for 6 seconds
- Role badge display uses `user.role_label ?? ROLE_LABELS[user.role]` (API label preferred)

#### Updated: `app/admin/users/actions.ts`
- `createUser` no longer requires or sends `password` in the request body

---

### Admin RBAC — Permissions Map & Route Guard

#### New: `lib/admin-permissions.ts`

```typescript
export const ROLE_ACCESS: Record<string, string[]> = {
  super_admin:   ["dashboard", "products", "orders", "quotes", "articles", "hero_slides", "brands", "settings", "users", "supplier"],
  admin:         ["dashboard", "products", "orders", "quotes", "articles", "hero_slides", "brands", "settings", "supplier"],
  editor:        ["dashboard", "articles", "hero_slides"],
  order_manager: ["dashboard", "orders", "quotes"],
};

export function canAccess(role: string, section: string): boolean { ... }
export const PATH_SECTION: Record<string, string> = { ... }; // path prefix → section key
```

Mirrors backend ENUM exactly. Role strings confirmed by backend: `super_admin`, `admin`, `editor`, `order_manager` only.

#### Shell nav filtering
```typescript
// Shows all items when role not yet loaded (!role fallback prevents
// blank nav for users whose admin_role cookie pre-dates this feature)
const visibleNav = NAV.filter(({ section }) =>
  section === null || !role || canAccess(role, section)
);
```

NAV items replaced hardcoded `roles` arrays with a `section` key. Profile always visible (`section: null`).

Result:
- `editor` → sees Dashboard, Articles, Hero Slides only
- `order_manager` → sees Dashboard, Orders, Quote Requests only
- `admin` → sees all except Users
- `super_admin` → sees everything

#### Client-side route guard (in `AdminShell`)
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!role) return;
  const section = Object.entries(PATH_SECTION).find(([path]) =>
    pathname.startsWith(path)
  )?.[1];
  if (section && !canAccess(role, section)) {
    router.replace("/admin/unauthorized");
  }
}, [pathname, role, router]);
```

Redirects to existing `/admin/unauthorized` page if a user navigates directly to a restricted section.

#### Updated: `lib/admin-api.ts`
Added to `AdminUser` and `AdminProfile` types:
- `role_label?: string` — human-readable label from API (e.g. `"Super Admin"`)
- `must_change_password?: boolean` — on `AdminProfile` only

---

### Bug Fix — `admin_role` Cookie Missing for Existing Sessions

**Problem:** After RBAC was added, users who had logged in before the `admin_role` cookie was introduced showed only the Profile nav item.

**Root cause:** The nav filter `section === null || canAccess(role, section)` — when `role = ""` (cookie absent), `canAccess` returns `false` for all sections. Only `section: null` (Profile) survived.

**Fix:** Added `|| !role` fallback so that when role is empty (not loaded or cookie not yet set), all nav items show. The route guard already had `if (!role) return` so it was not affected.

---

## Completed in Previous Session — Account Sub-pages & Shop Auth Fixes (2026-04-19)

### New Account Pages

All four pages below were missing (404) and have been created:

#### `app/account/quotes/page.tsx` — Quote Requests
Server component. Reads `customer_token` cookie; redirects if unauthenticated. Fetches `GET /api/v1/auth/quotes` with Bearer token.
- Status types: `pending | reviewed | approved | rejected` with colored badges
- Empty state with "Request a Quote" CTA linking to `/quote`
- Each quote shows: ref, product details, quantity, date, status badge, notes

#### `app/account/invoices/page.tsx` — Invoices
Server component. Fetches `GET /api/v1/auth/invoices` with Bearer token.
- Table: Invoice #, issued date, due date, amount (€), status badge, PDF download button
- Statuses: `paid` (green), `unpaid` (amber), `overdue` (red)
- Empty state with "Contact support" link

#### `app/account/company/page.tsx` — Company Details
Client component using `useCustomerAuth()`.
- Editable: Company Name, Industry (dropdown of 10 options)
- Read-only: VAT Number (with "Contact support to update" link), Email
- Saves via `updateCustomerProfile({ company_name, industry })`
- Success/error feedback inline

#### `app/account/vat/page.tsx` — VAT Status
Client component using `useCustomerAuth()`.
- If VAT on file: shows number, "VAT number on file" badge (green), "Verification pending" notice (amber), EU VIES portal link
- If no VAT: amber alert + "Contact support to add VAT" button
- Info card explaining B2B tax-exempt eligibility
- Link to `/account/company` for managing company details

#### `lib/customer-auth.ts`
Added `industry?: string` to `ProfileData` type (was missing, caused TypeScript error in company page).

---

### Shop — Proxy Routes with Auth Forwarding

Three Next.js API proxy routes forward `customer_token` cookie as `Authorization: Bearer` to the Laravel API, bypassing CORS:

| Route | Proxies to |
|---|---|
| `app/api/shop/products/route.ts` | `GET /api/v1/products?...` |
| `app/api/shop/brands/route.ts` | `GET /api/v1/products/brands` |
| `app/api/shop/specs/route.ts` | `GET /api/v1/products/specs` |

`shop-catalogue.tsx` updated to call these proxy routes (`/api/shop/products`, `/api/shop/brands`, `/api/shop/specs`) instead of calling the external API directly.

### Shop — Product Detail Page Auth
`app/shop/[id]/page.tsx`: reads `customer_token` cookie server-side, passes it to `apiFetch` as Bearer token. Previously returned 404 because unauthenticated requests got 401 from the API.

### Shop — Image Performance
- `product-card.tsx`: replaced `<img>` with Next.js `<Image fill>` + `sizes` prop
- `product-gallery.tsx`: replaced both main image and thumbnails with `<Image>`
- `product-grid.tsx`: passes `priority={i < 3}` to first 3 cards

### Login — Router Cache Fix
`app/login/page.tsx`: changed `router.push(destination)` to `window.location.href = destination` after successful login. Prevents Next.js router cache from replaying a stale `/shop → /login` redirect after the user had just authenticated.

---

## Completed in Previous Session — Auth Loading & Redirect Fixes (2026-04-18)

### Auth Loading Delay & Flash Fixed

**Problem:** Navbar briefly showed login icon (unauthenticated state) before switching to profile icon once `/me` fetch resolved.

**Changes:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `components/navbar.tsx` | Checks `isLoading` from `useCustomerAuth()`. Shows animated skeleton while loading instead of the login/profile button. |
| `app/login/page.tsx` | Calls `await refreshCustomer()` before `router.push()` so auth context is fully populated before the account page renders. |

### Middleware — `redirect` Param + Prefetch Skip

**File:** `middleware.ts`

1. **`callbackUrl` → `redirect`:** Login redirect URL param renamed. All server-side redirects updated to match. Login page reads `redirect` first, falls back to `callbackUrl`.

2. **Prefetch skip:** Middleware returns `NextResponse.next()` for requests with `Next-Router-Prefetch: 1` header to prevent Next.js caching stale redirects.

**Protected routes:** `/shop`, `/checkout`, `/account` (and all sub-paths).

---

## Completed in Previous Session — Customer Auth, Account Pages & Design Audit (2026-04-18)

### NextAuth Removed — Replaced with Direct Laravel Cookie Auth

`next-auth` has been **fully uninstalled**. The entire auth system now runs on a `customer_token` httpOnly cookie set by the Next.js API layer after proxying to Laravel.

**New auth files:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lib/customer-auth.ts` | Client-side helpers: `loginCustomer`, `registerCustomer`, `logoutCustomer`, `forgotPassword`, `resetPassword`, `getCustomerProfile`, `updateCustomerProfile`. All call relative `/api/auth/customer/*` routes. |
| `lib/get-customer.ts` | Server-side helper: `getCustomerFromCookie()` reads `customer_token` cookie and calls `GET /api/v1/auth/me` with Bearer token. |
| `context/CustomerAuthContext.tsx` | `CustomerAuthProvider` + `useCustomerAuth()` hook. State: `customer`, `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`. Methods: `login()`, `logout()`, `refreshCustomer()`. |

**New API proxy routes (all under `app/api/auth/customer/`):**

| Route | Method | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `login/route.ts` | POST | Proxies to Laravel `/auth/login`; sets httpOnly `customer_token` cookie (7-day) |
| `register/route.ts` | POST | Proxies to Laravel `/auth/register` |
| `logout/route.ts` | POST | Calls Laravel `/auth/logout`; always clears cookie |
| `forgot-password/route.ts` | POST | Proxies to Laravel `/auth/forgot-password` |
| `reset-password/route.ts` | POST | Proxies to Laravel `/auth/reset-password` |
| `me/route.ts` | GET | Reads cookie; proxies to Laravel `/auth/me` |
| `profile/route.ts` | PUT | Reads cookie; proxies to Laravel `/auth/profile` |
| `change-password/route.ts` | PUT | Proxies to Laravel `/auth/change-password` |
| `addresses/route.ts` | GET + POST | List and create addresses |
| `addresses/[id]/route.ts` | PUT + DELETE | Edit and delete addresses |

**`customer_type` values:** always lowercase — `"b2c"` and `"b2b"`.

---

### New Auth Pages

| Page | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Login | `app/login/page.tsx` | Email + password; handles `email_verified: false` and `must_reset: true` |
| Register | `app/register/page.tsx` | Individual/Business toggle; VAT validation; country/industry dropdowns |
| Forgot Password | `app/forgot-password/page.tsx` | Email input; success screen |
| Reset Password | `app/reset-password/page.tsx` | Token + email from URL; password strength indicator |
| Verify Email | `app/verify-email/page.tsx` | Resend button; `?verified=true` success state |

---

### Account Pages

| Page | Notes |
|---|---|
| `app/account/page.tsx` | B2C (3 cards) / B2B (6 cards) conditional dashboard |
| `app/account/profile/page.tsx` | Personal info + change password; toast feedback |
| `app/account/addresses/page.tsx` | Card grid; add/edit/delete modal; default badge |
| `app/account/orders/page.tsx` | Order list |
| `app/account/orders/[ref]/page.tsx` | Order detail + ShipmentTracker |
| `app/account/quotes/page.tsx` | Quote requests list with status badges |
| `app/account/invoices/page.tsx` | Invoices table with PDF download |
| `app/account/company/page.tsx` | Company name + industry edit; VAT read-only |
| `app/account/vat/page.tsx` | VAT status + VIES portal link |

---

## Completed in Previous Session — Adyen, Car Finder, Shipment Tracker & Supplier Intel (2026-04-18)

### Payment — Stripe replaced with Adyen Drop-in

Stripe fully removed. Adyen Web v6 Drop-in is now the payment provider. Adyen Sessions flow: Laravel creates session → returns `{ session_id, session_data, client_key }` → frontend mounts Drop-in via `useEffect`.

### Shop — Wheel-Size Car Finder (4-step cascade)

Make → Model → Year → Modification/Trim → Find Tyres.

## Admin Architecture

### Cookie Set on Login (`POST /api/v1/admin/login`)

Response shape: `{ data: { token: "...", user: { role, role_label, name, first_name, display_name, must_change_password, last_login_at, ... } } }`

| Cookie | httpOnly | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `admin_token` | ✅ | Auth bearer token — sent on every admin API call |
| `admin_role` | ❌ | Role string (`super_admin`, `admin`, `editor`, `order_manager`) — used for RBAC |
| `admin_role_label` | ❌ | Human-readable label from API (e.g. `"Super Admin"`) — shown in UI |
| `admin_name` | ❌ | Full name from API |
| `admin_display_name` | ❌ | Display name (prefers `display_name` → `first_name` → `name`) — shown in shell avatar |
| `admin_must_change` | ❌ | `"1"` if password change required — drives persistent amber banner |

### RBAC Permission Map (`lib/admin-permissions.ts`)

```
super_admin   → all sections (including eu_declarations)
admin         → all except users (including eu_declarations)
editor        → dashboard, articles, hero_slides, promotions, fet
order_manager → dashboard, orders, quotes, supplier, eu_declarations
```

`canAccess(role, section)` is the single source of truth. Used by:
- Shell sidebar nav filter
- Client-side route guard (redirects to `/admin/unauthorized`)

### Profile Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/admin/profile` → `{ data: { role, role_label, ... } }` (user object directly under `data`)
- `PUT /api/v1/admin/profile` → accepts `{ first_name, last_name, display_name, name }`
- `PUT /api/v1/admin/profile/password` → accepts `{ current_password, password, password_confirmation }`; returns `{ data: { user: { must_change_password: false, ... } } }`

## Auth Architecture (Customer)

```
Browser                Next.js                    Laravel API
  │                      │                              │
  ├─ POST /api/auth/customer/login ──────────────────► POST /api/v1/auth/login
  │                      │  ◄── { token, user } ────────┤
  │  ◄── Set-Cookie: customer_token (httpOnly) ─────────┤
  │                      │                              │
  ├─ GET /api/auth/customer/me ─────────────── Bearer ► GET /api/v1/auth/me
  │  ◄── { data: Customer } ────────────────────────────┤
  │                      │                              │
  └─ POST /api/auth/customer/logout ── Bearer ────────► POST /api/v1/auth/logout
     ◄── cookie cleared ──────────────────────────────  │
```

**Middleware:** Reads `customer_token` cookie synchronously. Redirects to `/login?redirect={path}` for protected routes. Prefetch requests (`Next-Router-Prefetch: 1`) always pass through.

**Server components:** Use `getCustomerFromCookie()` from `lib/get-customer.ts`.
**Client components:** Use `useCustomerAuth()` from `context/CustomerAuthContext.tsx`.

## Completed in Session — Stripe Checkout Fixes (2026-05-02)

### Stripe Session Proxy — Body Forwarding Fix

**File:** `app/api/checkout/stripe-session/route.ts`

**Problem:** `request.text()` can return an empty string under certain Next.js 16 conditions, causing the proxy to forward `{}` to Laravel. Laravel validated `payment_method` as required and returned a 422 error visible to the user.

**Fix:**
- Switched from `request.text()` to `request.json()` + `JSON.stringify()` — body is explicitly parsed then re-serialised, throwing cleanly if empty/invalid
- Hardcoded `Content-Type: application/json` on the outbound request (no longer reflects the incoming header, which could carry a charset suffix)

**Diagnostic logging added (temporary):**
```
[stripe-session] target URL      — exact Laravel endpoint (confirms API_URL env var)
[stripe-session] request body    — full payload forwarded
[stripe-session] HTTP status     — Laravel response code
[stripe-session] has checkout_url — whether data.checkout_url is a string
[stripe-session] has order_ref   — whether data.order_ref is a string
[stripe-session] raw response    — first 600 chars of Laravel response
```

**API URL resolution order:**
```
process.env.API_URL  >  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL  >  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1"
```
Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.okelcor.com/api/v1` is set in all deployment environments.

---

### Checkout Return Page — Stripe-Only Rewrite

**File:** `app/checkout/return/page.tsx`

Full rewrite to remove dead Mollie code and align with Stripe Checkout + backend webhook flow.

**Changes:**
- Removed: loading / pending / failed states, Mollie status-check fetch, `amount` state, `Loader2` import
- Two states only:
  - `session_id` in URL → **"Order received"** card (success)
  - No `session_id` → **"Check your email"** card (fallback / direct nav)
- Copy: *"Your payment was submitted successfully. We'll email your confirmation once Stripe confirms the payment."* — avoids claiming payment is confirmed from URL alone (webhook is source of truth)
- `order_ref` display: shown as a pill when present
- All colours use CSS variables (`var(--primary)`, `var(--foreground)`, `var(--muted)`)

**`order_ref` reading (reliable, two-source):**
```typescript
// 1. URL param — present if backend includes order_ref in Stripe success_url
const queryOrderRef = searchParams.get("order_ref") ?? "";

// 2. sessionStorage fallback — written by checkout-flow.tsx before redirect
const [sessionRef, setSessionRef] = useState("");
useEffect(() => {
  const stored = sessionStorage.getItem("stripe_order_ref") ?? "";
  if (stored) setSessionRef(stored);
  sessionStorage.removeItem("stripe_checkout_session_id");
  sessionStorage.removeItem("stripe_order_ref");
}, []);

const orderRef = queryOrderRef || sessionRef;
```

Key fix from previous bug: `orderRef` is derived reactively from `queryOrderRef` (not frozen in a lazy `useState` initialiser), so it updates correctly after `useSearchParams()` resolves during hydration.

---

### Checkout Flow — Reliable sessionStorage Writes

**File:** `components/checkout/checkout-flow.tsx`

**Problem:** sessionStorage was only written inside `if` guards — if the backend response omitted `order_ref`, the key was never set and the return page fallback silently had nothing to read.

**Fix:** Unconditional writes with explicit variable extraction:
```typescript
const checkoutSession = String(checkoutData.checkout_session_id ?? "");
const orderRef        = String(checkoutData.order_ref ?? "");

sessionStorage.setItem("stripe_checkout_session_id", checkoutSession);
sessionStorage.setItem("stripe_order_ref", orderRef);
// → then clearCart() + window.location.href = checkoutUrl
```

Both keys are **always written before the Stripe redirect**, even if empty, so the return page always finds consistent keys in sessionStorage.

**Backend response shape expected:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkout_url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/...",
    "checkout_session_id": "cs_...",
    "order_ref": "OKL-XXXXX"
  }
}
```

---

### Stripe Checkout — Frontend/Backend Contract (Confirmed)

| Thing | Who handles it |
|---|---|
| Customer confirmation email | Backend (auto, on `checkout.session.completed` webhook) |
| Admin notification email | Backend (auto, on webhook) |
| `/checkout/return` page | Frontend ✅ |
| `/checkout/cancel` page | Frontend ✅ |
| Showing `order_ref` on return page | Frontend reads from URL param → sessionStorage fallback |

**Important timing:** Stripe redirect fires before the webhook. Never fetch order status on the return page — the webhook may not have fired yet. Email is the source of truth.

---

## Completed in Session — Domain Migration & Customer Email Blast (2026-04-22/23)

### Domain: okelcor.de → okelcor.com

The website is now live at **okelcor.com**. All okelcor.de email references updated:

- `lib/constants.ts` — `COMPANY_EMAIL` → `info@okelcor.com`, `COMPANY_NOREPLY_EMAIL` → `noreply@okelcor.com`
- `components/admin/settings-panel.tsx` — contact/quote email defaults → `info@okelcor.com`
- `lib/translations.ts` — all 7 `errGeneric` messages (EN/DE/FR/ES) → `info@okelcor.com`
- `app/sitemap.ts` — added `/fet` route (priority 0.8)
- `next.config.ts` — already had `api.okelcor.com` image hostname (no change needed)

**Note:** Domain-level redirect (okelcor.de → okelcor.com) must be configured at the DNS/hosting provider — not possible from within Next.js.

### Admin — Platform Migration Email

Allows admins to notify all registered customers about the new platform and prompt password setup.

#### New: `app/api/admin/customers/migration-email/route.ts`
- `POST` with `{ test_mode: true }` → sends to `johngraphics18@gmail.com` only
- `POST` with `{ test_mode: false }` → paginates all customers, batches 100 per Resend `batch.send()` call
- Returns `{ sent, failed, total, test_mode }`
- Requires `admin_token` cookie (same auth as all admin routes)

#### Updated: `app/admin/customers/page.tsx`
New "Platform Migration Email" card with:
- Description + amber warning banner (test first)
- **Send Test Email** button → test mode send
- **Send to All Customers** button → opens confirmation modal
- Confirmation modal with cancel/confirm
- Result cards showing sent/failed/total counts

Email template: dark Okelcor header, migration announcement, "Set Your Password →" CTA to `/forgot-password`, "What's new" feature list, branded footer.

## Known Issues / Remaining Tasks

### High Priority

1. **"No entry certificate exists for this order" — backend fix required** — Customer submits the EU Entry Certificate form successfully (client-side validation passes, proxy reaches backend), but `POST /api/v1/auth/orders/{ref}/declaration` returns this error. Root cause: the endpoint expects an existing `eu_declarations` row but older reverse-charge orders created before Phase 2B were never given one. Backend fix: if no row exists and `order.is_reverse_charge === true` (or `order.tax_treatment === "reverse_charge"`), create a pending `eu_declarations` row on demand via `EuDeclarationService::createForOrder($order)` before processing the signature. The Laravel backend is hosted separately at `api.okelcor.de` — not in this repository.

2. **Admin EU Declaration — backend endpoints not yet added (Phase 2B-4 frontend ready)** — Four backend changes needed (see Phase 2B-4 section above):
   - `PATCH /api/v1/admin/eu-declarations/{id}/acknowledge` — must be added
   - `GET /api/v1/admin/eu-declarations/{id}/download` — must be added
   - `GET /api/v1/admin/eu-declarations/{id}` — must return all form fields
   - Address snapshot fix — delivery address/VAT must be snapshotted onto `eu_declarations` at signing time
   Frontend proxy routes and UI are fully wired and waiting.

2. **Stripe `order_ref` not displayed on return page — backend fix required** — Root cause confirmed: Laravel's `POST /payments/create-session` does not return `order_ref` because the order is created by the Stripe webhook, not at session creation time. Frontend is already wired and waiting. Backend must: (a) create the `Order` record at session creation time with `status: pending`, `payment_status: pending`, (b) return `order_ref` in `data.order_ref`, (c) embed it in the Stripe `success_url` as `?order_ref=OKL-XXXXX`, (d) have the webhook update the existing order (paid + confirmed) instead of creating a new one. No frontend changes needed.

### Medium Priority

2. **Crisp live chat `X-Crisp-Tier` unresolved** — Main currently uses `"website"` tier (working). User confirmed credentials require `"plugin"` tier, but switching to `plugin` on main caused 404. Must test in isolation on the production Crisp account before merging dev version. Dev branch has `plugin` + simplified env vars (`CRISP_IDENTIFIER`/`CRISP_KEY` only). Do not merge until confirmed.

3. **Stripe diagnostic logging** — Temporary `console.log` lines in `app/api/checkout/stripe-session/route.ts` (target URL, request body, HTTP status, has checkout_url, has order_ref). Remove once the backend confirms the response shape.

4. **Invoice download debug logs** — Temporary `console.log` lines in `app/api/account/invoices/[id]/download/route.ts` (token present, target URL, Laravel status, error body). Remove once PDF download is confirmed working in production.

5. **Admin quote attachment debug log** — Temporary `console.log` in `app/admin/quotes/[id]/page.tsx` logging all 6 attachment field values. Remove once attachment display is confirmed.

6. **Admin existing sessions after RBAC** — Users who logged in before `admin_role` cookie was introduced will see all nav items. They need to log out and back in once.

7. **DNS redirect** — Configure okelcor.de → okelcor.com redirect at DNS/hosting level.

8. **Namecheap deploy pending** — Backend commits `b89dd2e` (bus freight tracking), `996fc0b` (email deliverability), `fbe2d3f` (bank details), `0e8cdfa` (carrier_type fix), `3e7e682`/`50ffd1c` (event_date fix) need deploying. Run `php artisan migrate --force` — two new migrations in `b89dd2e`.

### Low Priority

9. **Newsletter backend** — `components/newsletter-strip.tsx` shows success UI but does not POST to any endpoint.

10. **Unused public assets** — Old placeholder SVGs in `public/brands/` safe to delete.

---

## Development Workflow

Before making UI changes, always read:
1. `docs/architecture.md`
2. `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
3. `docs/page-guidelines.md`
4. `docs/session-handoff.md`
5. `docs/visual-references.md`

Rules:
- Use `var(--primary)`, `var(--primary-hover)`, `var(--foreground)`, `var(--muted)` — never hardcode duplicates
- The FET page (`/fet`) uses its own green palette — do NOT apply `var(--primary)` orange there
- All buttons use `rounded-full` (pill shape)
- Prefer server components; only use `"use client"` where hooks or browser APIs are required
- i18n: use `useLanguage()` in client wrappers
- Auth (customer): use `useCustomerAuth()` in client components; `getCustomerFromCookie()` in server components; never import from `next-auth`
- Auth (admin): use `adminApiFetch()` from `lib/admin-api.ts`; permissions via `canAccess()` from `lib/admin-permissions.ts`
- `customer_type` values are always lowercase: `"b2c"` or `"b2b"`
- Admin login response shape: `json.data.user` (not `json.data.admin`)
- Admin profile/me response shape: `json.data` directly (no `.user` wrapper)
